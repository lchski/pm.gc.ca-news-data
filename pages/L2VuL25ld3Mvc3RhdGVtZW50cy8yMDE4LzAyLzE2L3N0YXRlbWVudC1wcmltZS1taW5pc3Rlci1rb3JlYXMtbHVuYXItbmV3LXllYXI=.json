It is a time for friends and family to come together in a spirit of celebration, renewal, and hope for the future. During this three-day holiday, loved ones will share Korean delicacies, like tteokguk (<b>떡국</b>), a rice cake soup, or jeon (<b>전</b>), savoury pancakes made of seafood, meat, or vegetables.</p><p>“This year, Seollal has special significance for the people of South Korea, as they welcome the world during the 2018 Olympic Winter Games. In Canada, Korea’s Lunar New Year is also a chance to celebrate the many contributions of the Korean Canadian community. Korean Canadians have made our country stronger, more inclusive, and more prosperous for generations. As we move forward together in 2018, let’s continue to celebrate everything that unites us, and the diversity that makes us strong.</p><p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish happiness, health, and joy to all those celebrating Seollal.</p><p>“<b>새해</b><b>복</b><b>많이</b><b>받으세요</b>”</p></div>\n      "
