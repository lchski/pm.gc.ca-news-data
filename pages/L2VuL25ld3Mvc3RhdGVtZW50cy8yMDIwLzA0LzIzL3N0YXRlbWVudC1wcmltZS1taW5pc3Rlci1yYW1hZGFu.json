Families and friends observe Ramadan by getting together, fasting during the day, and ending their day with iftar. This year, Ramadan will look different as we continue to fight the global COVID-19 pandemic, and work to protect our communities by staying home and following the advice of public health experts. From mosques hosting Friday prayers online to families having iftar virtually, Muslim Canadians will be doing their part this year.</p>\n\n<p>“During this crisis, the values at the heart of Islam – compassion, gratitude, and generosity – resonate more than ever, as we see Muslim Canadians helping their neighbours. A time of charity and spiritual contemplation, Ramadan reminds us to put the needs of others before our own and to practice those values in our daily lives.</p>\n\n<p>“Let us take the time to recognize, and show gratitude for, the invaluable contributions Muslim Canadians make each day to our country.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating a blessed and peaceful Ramadan.</p>\n\n<p>“Ramadan Mubarak.”</p></div>\n      "
