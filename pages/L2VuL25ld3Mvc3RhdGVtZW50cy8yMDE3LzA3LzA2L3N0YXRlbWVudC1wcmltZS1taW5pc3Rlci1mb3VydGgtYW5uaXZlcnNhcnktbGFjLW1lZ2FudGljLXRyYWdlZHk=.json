Just after midnight, a train carrying crude oil derailed and exploded in the heart of this community, taking with it the lives of 47 people in one of the worst rail disasters in Canadian history. Our thoughts are with their families, and all those whose lives were changed that day.</p><p>“Four years later, this close-knit community continues to show profound resiliency in the face of the scars and trauma of those horrible events. Lac-Mégantic is rebuilding itself once again into a beautiful, vibrant, and dynamic place to live, work, and visit.&nbsp;</p><p>“No community should ever experience what Lac-Mégantic went through. I am committed to ensuring that rail safety remains a top priority.</p><p>“To the people of Lac-Mégantic, please know that you remain in our thoughts and prayers and that you are present in every decision we make on this very important matter. We will not let up on our commitment to make the railway system safer and better for communities like yours all across Canada.”</p></div>\n      "
