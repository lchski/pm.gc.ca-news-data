Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada</cite></p></blockquote><h2>Quick Facts</h2><ul><li>Under the Canadian Constitution, the Governor General appoints people to the Senate. By convention, Senators are appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister.</li><li>For the first time ever, the process was opened up to allow Canadians to apply. Following a four-week application period, which generated over 2,700 applications from Canadians across the country, the candidate submissions were reviewed by the Independent Advisory Board for Senate Appointments, which then provided the Prime Minister with non-binding recommendations. From that pool of candidates, the Prime Minister selected the nine people he will recommend to the Governor General for appointment to the Senate.</li><li>In making their recommendations, the Independent Advisory Board for Senate Appointments was guided by public, transparent, non-partisan and merit-based criteria to identify highly-qualified people.</li><li>Once appointed by the Governor General and summoned to the Senate, the new Senators will join their peers in examining and revising legislation, investigating national issues, and representing regional, provincial and minority interests – all important functions in a modern democracy.</li></ul><h2>Related Product</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/en/news/backgrounders/2016/10/27/biographical-notes\">Biographical Notes</a></li></ul><h2>Associated Links</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/campaign/independent-advisory-board-for-senate-appointments.html\">Independent Advisory Board for Senate Appointments</a></li><li><a href=\"/en/news/news-releases/2016/03/18/prime-minister-announces-intention-recommend-appointment-seven-new\">Prime Minister announces intention to recommend the appointment of seven new Senators</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.democraticinstitutions.gc.ca/eng/content/minister-democratic-institutions-announces-launch-permanent-phase-independent-senate\">Minister of Democratic Institutions Announces Launch of the Permanent Phase of the Independent Senate Appointments Process</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.democraticinstitutions.gc.ca/eng/content/minister-democratic-institutions-announces-establishment-independent-advisory-board-senate\">Minister of Democratic Institutions Announces Establishment of the Independent Advisory Board for Senate Appointments</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.democraticinstitutions.gc.ca/eng/content/government-announces-immediate-senate-reform\">Government Announces Immediate Senate Reform</a></li></ul></div>\n      "
