As Sikhs honour the life of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, I hope we all can find inspiration in his teachings, and in his universal and timeless message for all of us.</p>\n\n<p>“This day is also an opportunity to recognize the contributions Sikh Canadians have made – and continue to make – to create a better Canada.
