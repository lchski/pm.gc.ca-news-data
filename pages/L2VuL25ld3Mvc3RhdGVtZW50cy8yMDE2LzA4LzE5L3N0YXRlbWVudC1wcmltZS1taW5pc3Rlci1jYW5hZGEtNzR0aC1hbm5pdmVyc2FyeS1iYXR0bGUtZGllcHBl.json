They fought through barbed wire, mortar barrages, and machine gun fire. Many never made it beyond the beach where they landed.</p>\n<p>“In the air, Royal Air Force and Royal Canadian Air Force fighters and bombers waged one of the most intense air battles in the whole war.</p>\n<p>“After nine hours of fighting, Canadian and Allied forces withdrew.</p>\n<p>“The operation came at a steep price for Canada. More than 3,300 Canadians were killed, wounded, or taken prisoner.</p>\n<p>“These sacrifices were not made in vain. The raid on Dieppe led to a better understanding of enemy defences and laid the groundwork for future Allied amphibious assaults – including D-Day.</p>\n<p>“On this solemn day, we honour the courage and sacrifice of the thousands of Canadians who fought alongside Allied forces in Dieppe.</p>\n<p>“Let us remember those who gave so much so that we could enjoy the peace and freedoms that we do today.”</p></div>\n      "
