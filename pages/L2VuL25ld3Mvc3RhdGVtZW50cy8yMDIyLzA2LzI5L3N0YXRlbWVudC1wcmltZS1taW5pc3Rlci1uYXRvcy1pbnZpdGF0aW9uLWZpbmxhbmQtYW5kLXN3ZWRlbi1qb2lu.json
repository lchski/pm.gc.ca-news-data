Canada strongly supports their application and we have always welcomed their close partnership with the Alliance and their valuable contributions to transatlantic security.</p>\n\n<p>“As a close friend and security partner, Canada will support Finland and Sweden through the accession process, including against threats to their security. It will be important for all NATO members to move swiftly to complete their NATO membership to limit opportunities for interference by adversaries.</p>\n\n<p>“At home, Canada has taken quick action to accelerate this process and we will continue to work as quickly as possible to make this a reality.

Their membership will make NATO stronger.</p>\n\n<p>“Canada remains a champion of NATO’s Open Door Policy for any European country in a position to advance the commitments and obligations of membership, such as protecting democracy, and contribute to the collective defence of the Alliance.”</p></div>\n      "
