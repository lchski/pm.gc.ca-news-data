For millennia, Nowruz – which means ‘new day’– has brought family and friends together around the haft-seen table to celebrate, feast, and appreciate life’s gifts.</p>\n\n<p>“Around the globe, millions embrace Nowruz as a chance to reflect on the past year and share aspirations for a peaceful and harmonious year ahead. For Bahá’ís, this occasion is celebrated as a Holy Day, marking the end of 19 days of fasting and the beginning of a new year in the Bahá’í calendar.</p>\n\n<p>“Nowruz reminds us that inclusion and respect for diversity is our greatest strength. Today, we take time to thank the many communities that observe Nowruz for their important contributions to building a better Canada.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I extend our best wishes to all who celebrate Nowruz. May you have a prosperous and joyful New Year.</p>\n\n<p>“Har Ruz etan Nowrouz, Nowruz etan Pyrouz.”</p></div>\n      "
