Every night for the next month, thousands of lights will shine in Canadian capitals from coast to coast to coast, reminding us of the spirit of the season and all that brings us together as a country.</p>\n\n<p>“As the end of the year approaches and we celebrate our favourite traditions, let us all do our part to give back. Acts of kindness — from volunteering at a local food bank, helping a neighbour shovel their driveway, or writing a <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/contact-us/write-troops.html\">letter to a Canadian Armed Forces member away for the holidays</a> — bring us closer as we build a better Canada for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, I invite people to take time out to watch as Christmas Lights Across Canada lights up the long winter nights. From our family to yours, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating a joyful Christmas season.”</p></div>\n      "
