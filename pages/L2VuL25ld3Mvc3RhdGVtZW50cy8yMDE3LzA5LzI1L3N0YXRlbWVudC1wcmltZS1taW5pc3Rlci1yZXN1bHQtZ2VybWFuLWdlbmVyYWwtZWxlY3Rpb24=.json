Her principal challenger, Martin Schulz, led a formidable campaign. The closeness of the vote and scope of issues debated was a testament to the vibrancy of Germany’s democracy.</p><p>“As the next German government takes shape, I look forward to continuing to work with Chancellor Merkel and her interim government on issues that matter to both Canadians and Germans, including international security, climate change, managed migration for those displaced due to crisis, and the implementation of the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement.</p><p>“Canada and Germany are bound by more than just common interests. We are compassionate societies that understand diversity is a source of strength. Our institutions aspire to show openness and respect to all people, and we share a vision of progressive, sustainable economies that benefit everyone. These values will guide us as we move forward together to face the most pressing issues of our time.”</p></div>\n      "
