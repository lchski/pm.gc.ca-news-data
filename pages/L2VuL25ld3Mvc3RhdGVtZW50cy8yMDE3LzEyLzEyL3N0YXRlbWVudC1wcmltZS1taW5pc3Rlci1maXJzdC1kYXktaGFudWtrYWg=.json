Together, they will pray, sing, enjoy food, and share stories of hope.</p><p>“Hanukkah is a time to honour the profound strength of the Jewish people, and their triumph over immense adversity. Each Hanukkah candle reminds us that love conquers hatred, that light drowns out darkness, and that even our smallest actions have the power to make a difference in the world.</p><p>“This year, we have marked 150 years of Confederation – a chance to celebrate the many cultures, traditions, and beliefs that help make Canada such a wonderful place to live. Jewish Canadians have made significant contributions to our communities and our country, and continue to make Canada inclusive, open, and strong.</p><p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish all those celebrating a happy and peaceful Hanukkah.</p><p>“<i>Chag Hanukkah Sameach.</i>”</p></div>\n      "
