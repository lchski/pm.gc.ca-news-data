A lawyer by trade, Mr. Pawley served as Premier of Manitoba from 1981 to 1988. After politics, he joined academia, teaching political science and law at the University of Windsor, where he later served as Associate Professor Emeritus until his death.</p>\n<p>“Today we mourn the loss of an exceptional visionary whose trail-blazing work made life better for the citizens of Manitoba and, by extension, for all Canadians. His legacy will live on in the many advances our country has made toward achieving greater social justice for all.”</p></div>\n      "
