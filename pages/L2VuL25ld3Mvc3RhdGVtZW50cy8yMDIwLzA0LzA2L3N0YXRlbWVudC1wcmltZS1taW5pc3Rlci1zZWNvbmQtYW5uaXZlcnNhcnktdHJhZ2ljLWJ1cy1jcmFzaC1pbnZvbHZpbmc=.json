As they work through feelings of loss, grief, and anger, we join them to mourn the lives lost too soon.</p>\n\n<p>“The recovery of the Humboldt Broncos community from this devastating loss demonstrates its strength and resilience, and the incredible compassion that Canadians have for each other. The outpouring of support from across the country will never be forgotten. We will remember the jerseys worn by countless Canadians, the hockey sticks placed outside front doors from coast to coast to coast, and the donations raised to help the families and survivors.</p>\n\n<p>“To the Humboldt community: we are here for you. We will not forget your loved ones, or the resilience and strength you have shown as a community.”</p></div>\n      "
