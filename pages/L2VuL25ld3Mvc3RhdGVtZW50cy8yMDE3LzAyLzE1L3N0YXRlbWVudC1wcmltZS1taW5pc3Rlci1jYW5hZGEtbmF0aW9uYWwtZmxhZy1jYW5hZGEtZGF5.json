Beavers and canoes may be just as enduring, but only the maple leaf has come to represent unity, hope, generosity, openness, and respect – and the nation and its people who live up to those values every day. It is fitting that this cherished symbol is at the heart of Canada’s flag.</p>\n\n<p>“Today, I invite all Canadians to reflect on what the maple leaf flag means to them, what it stands for around the world, and how it has helped shape our national identity. I also invite you to take part in Canadian Heritage’s <a href=\"http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1449158599459/1452877117760\">Share your moment with the flag challenge</a> and celebrate one of our greatest national symbols.”</p></div>\n      "
