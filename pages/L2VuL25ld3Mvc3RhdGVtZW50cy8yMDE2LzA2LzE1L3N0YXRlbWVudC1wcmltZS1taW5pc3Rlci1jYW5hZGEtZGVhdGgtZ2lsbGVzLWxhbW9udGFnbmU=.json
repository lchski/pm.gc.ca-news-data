His service to Canada started at a young age, when he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force during the Second World War and survived almost two years as a prisoner of war in Germany.</p>\n<p>“After distinguishing himself as a military officer, Mr. Lamontagne continued serving the public good. In a career that spanned more than 30 years, he served as Mayor of Quebec City, Member of Parliament, Parliamentary Secretary, Minister of various federal departments, and Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec. In all capacities, he served with exemplary dedication and compassion.</p>\n<p>“For his efforts, Mr. Lamontagne was named an Officer of the Order of Canada, a Knight of the <em>Ordre national du Québec</em>, a Knight of the French Legion of Honor, and received the Diamond Jubilee medal.</p>\n<p>“On a personal level, I will remember Gilles mostly through the stories told by my father – of their time spent together in Montreal as teenagers and of his strong moral compass.</p>\n<p>“On behalf of all Canadians, Sophie and I offer our deepest condolences to the family and friends of this remarkable man. We join Quebecers and all Canadians in mourning the passing of this great man.”</p></div>\n      "
