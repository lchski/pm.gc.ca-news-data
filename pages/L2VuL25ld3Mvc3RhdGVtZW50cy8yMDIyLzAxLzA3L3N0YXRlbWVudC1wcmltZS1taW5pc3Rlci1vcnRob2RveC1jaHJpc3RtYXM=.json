Although celebrations may look different again this year, as we keep following public health guidelines to ensure everyone’s safety, Christmas continues to remind us of the values of peace, compassion, and generosity that define us as Canadians and bring us together.</p>\n\n<p>“Christmas is also a time of giving, especially to those in need – whether it’s giving a helping hand, a charitable donation, or a good word. During this festive season, I encourage all Canadians to think of the people around us – friends, neighbours, and community members – who may have experienced hardship this year, or are impacted by the pandemic, and to offer them support.</p>\n\n<p>“On this day, we also recognize the important contributions that Orthodox Christians and Eastern Rite Catholics make to help build a better, fairer, and more inclusive Canada for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating today a merry Christmas.”</p></div>\n      "
