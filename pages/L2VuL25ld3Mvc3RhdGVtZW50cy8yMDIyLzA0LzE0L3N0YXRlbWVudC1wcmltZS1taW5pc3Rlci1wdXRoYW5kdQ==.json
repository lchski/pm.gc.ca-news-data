To mark this occasion, family and friends will come together to enjoy delicious food, exchange gifts and greetings, and decorate their homes with kolams – traditional art drawn with rice flour. As we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, I know Tamil Canadians will continue to honour their longstanding traditions and give thanks for the blessings in their lives.</p>\n\n<p>“As Tamil Canadians celebrate the New Year, let us take this opportunity to recognize the important contributions they have made – and continue to make – to our country’s social, economic, and cultural fabric. Together, we will continue to build a better, fairer, and more inclusive future for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating health, happiness, and prosperity in the New Year.</p>\n\n<p>“Iniya Puthandu Nalvazhthukkal.”</p></div>\n      "
