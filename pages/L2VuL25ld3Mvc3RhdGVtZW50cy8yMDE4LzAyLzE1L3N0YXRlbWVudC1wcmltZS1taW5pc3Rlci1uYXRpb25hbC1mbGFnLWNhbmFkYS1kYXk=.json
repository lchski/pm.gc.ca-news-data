Over the past week, we have watched some of these Canadians, on slopes and rinks, reach the top of the Olympic podium and hoist our flag high.</p><p>“The Maple Leaf is a source of pride, but it also challenges us. While we have come a long way since the Maple Leaf flew for the first time, our work is not finished. Every day, we must make a conscious choice to live up to our values and the spirit of our ideals, and strive closer to a country that empowers every Canadian, no matter their background or where they are from. &nbsp;</p><p>“This year, as National Flag of Canada Day falls during the 2018 Winter Olympics, I invite Canadians to cheer on our Olympic and Paralympic athletes and honour the Maple Leaf that brings us all together.”&nbsp;</p></div>\n      "
