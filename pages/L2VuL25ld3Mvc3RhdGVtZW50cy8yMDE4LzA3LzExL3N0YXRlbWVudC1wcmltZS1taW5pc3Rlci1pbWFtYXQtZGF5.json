This centre leads vital conversations on how diversity and pluralism enrich our communities and strengthen our societies.</p><p>“Today, as celebrations for his diamond jubilee year come to a close, we reflect on the Aga Khan’s example, the importance of seeing ourselves in each other, and building bridges, rather than barriers, between communities.</p><p>“I wish all Ismaili Canadians celebrating Imamat Day a heartfelt Khushiali Mubarak!”</p></div>\n      "
