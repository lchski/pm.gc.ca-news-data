We hold the victims in our hearts, along with their families and loved ones, and all those whose lives were marked by this tragedy.</p><p>“We also recognize the heroes and first responders who saved lives that night and answered this act of hatred with courage. In the days and weeks that followed, Québec City – and communities across the country – did the same. Canadians came together to stand with our country’s Muslim communities, uniting in solidarity and hope.</p><p>“Today, we continue to speak with one voice: Islamophobia, hate, and discrimination have no place here or anywhere. We will never allow fear to divide us, and we will always defend the values that make us strong – openness, inclusion, equality, and the freedom to practice religion in safety and peace.</p><p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, I ask all Canadians to pause today and remember the victims. They will stay in our hearts and memories forever.”</p></div>\n      "
