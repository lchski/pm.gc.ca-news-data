Now more than ever, we see these teachings put into practice as we take care of one another during this pandemic. We will get through this together.</p>\n\n<p>“On this occasion, I invite all Canadians to honour our Buddhist communities and to recognize their important contributions to our country.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating a happy and peaceful Vesak.”</p></div>\n      "
