A few months ago, when the community of Fort McMurray was devastated by wildfires, the community of Lac-Mégantic reached out with an immediate outpouring of support. Canadians continue to be deeply moved by the strength and selflessness of the people of Lac-Mégantic, who lent a hand to distant neighbours, even while their own efforts to rebuild continue.</p>\n<p>“Rail safety remains a top priority for the Government of Canada, and we will continue to take steps to improve the safety of the Canadian rail system. The Minister of Transport, Marc Garneau, visited Lac-Mégantic in April to hear from those most directly affected by the tragedy.</p>\n<p>“To the people of Lac-Mégantic, please know that you have our steadfast support as you continue to recover and heal. We remember you and all that you lost, and will use this memory to strengthen our resolve to make our railroads the safest in the world, and ensure the tragic events of Lac-Mégantic never happen again.”&nbsp;</p></div>\n      "
