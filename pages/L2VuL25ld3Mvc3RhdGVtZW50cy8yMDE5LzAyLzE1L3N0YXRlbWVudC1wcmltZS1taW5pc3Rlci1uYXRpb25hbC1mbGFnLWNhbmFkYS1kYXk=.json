Although young, like the country it represents, the Maple Leaf has traversed the world over and stood centre-stage for moment after moment in Canadian history.</p>\n\n<p>“A rich history, a bold future – the Maple Leaf captures both thanks to generations of Canadians who have worked hard for a better life, and created more opportunity for all.</p>\n\n<p>“Beyond our borders, our flag has become an emblem that garners respect and admiration, whether waving outside an embassy, adorning a backpack, or soaring into orbit.</p>\n\n<p>“Today, I encourage Canadians to reflect on what the Maple Leaf means to them, how it has shaped our identity as a country, and what it stands for around the world.”</p></div>\n      "
