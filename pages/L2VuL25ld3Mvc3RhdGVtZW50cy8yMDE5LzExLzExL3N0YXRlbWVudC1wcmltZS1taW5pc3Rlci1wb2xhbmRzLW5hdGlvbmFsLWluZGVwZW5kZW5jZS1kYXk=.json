Polish soldiers trained in Canada as early as 1917 in Niagara-on-the-Lake. Our countries fought side by side in the Second World War and have served together as NATO Allies for more than two decades, including through the Canada-led multinational enhanced Forward Presence Battle Group in Latvia.</p>\n\n<p>“Today, Poland and Canada work together in international institutions like the United&nbsp;Nations to advance peace and security around the world. We are active trading partners through the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, which is creating new opportunities and good jobs for people on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>\n\n<p>“The bond between Canada and Poland has deep roots in our close people-to-people ties. Our country’s very first Parliament, in 1867, included a Canadian of Polish descent, Alexandre-Édouard Kierzkowski. Today, more than one million people of Polish descent call Canada home, and each day, Polish Canadians help build a stronger, more inclusive Canada.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I offer our best wishes to all those celebrating Poland’s National Independence Day.”</p></div>\n      "
