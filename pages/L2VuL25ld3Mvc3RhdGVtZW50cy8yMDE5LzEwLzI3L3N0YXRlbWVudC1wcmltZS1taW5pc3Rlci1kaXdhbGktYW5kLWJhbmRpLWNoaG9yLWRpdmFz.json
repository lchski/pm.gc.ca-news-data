Loved ones will gather to feast, exchange gifts, and pray, as they light up their homes with diyas.</p>\n\n<p>“Here in Canada, these celebrations are a reminder of the diversity and inclusion that build stronger and more vibrant communities. They are also an opportunity to recognize the important contributions that Canadians of Hindu, Sikh, Jain, and Buddhist faiths make to our country every day.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I wish a happy Diwali and Bandi Chhor Divas to everyone celebrating.”</p></div>\n      "
