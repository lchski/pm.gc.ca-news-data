Thomas Molloy, after a battle with cancer.</p>\n\n<p>“Mr. Molloy’s life was defined by his dedicated service to others. His exceptional career as a negotiator, lawyer, and author, as well as his work to advance reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, left an indelible mark on his beloved province and Canada as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>“Mr. Molloy was the lead federal negotiator for the largest land claim settlement in Canadian history – the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement – which led to the establishment of Nunavut in 1999. He also led negotiations on the first modern-day treaty in British Columbia – the Nisga’a Final Agreement – and helped pave the way for a renewed relationship between the Nisga’a Nation and the Crown.</p>\n\n<p>“For his contributions, Mr. Molloy was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada, invested with the Saskatchewan Order of Merit, and received numerous awards for his work in his hometown of Saskatoon. He also served as Chancellor of his alma mater, the University of Saskatchewan, from 2001 to 2007. His many recognitions speak to the lives he changed for the better.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of all Canadians, Sophie and I offer our deepest condolences to Mr. Molloy’s family and friends, and to the people of Saskatchewan. His work and legacy will live on.”</p></div>\n      "
