Vesak is a time to commemorate the birth, enlightenment, and passing of the founder of Buddhism, Gautama Buddha.</p><p>“On this occasion, people will visit their local temples to pray, and offer gifts to show respect and gratitude for the Buddha’s life and wisdom. They will also reflect on his teachings about peace, selfless service, and compassion to those in need.</p><p>“This festival reminds us that we can practice these teachings each day, by respecting the beliefs of others, showing kindness to people around us, and seeing ourselves in each other.</p><p>“Vesak is also an opportunity for Canadians to honour our Buddhist communities, and their important contributions to our country. Today, I encourage all Canadians to reflect on the Buddha’s universal teachings, and reaffirm our commitment to build a stronger, more open, and more inclusive world.</p><p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating a happy and peaceful Vesak.”</p></div>\n      "
