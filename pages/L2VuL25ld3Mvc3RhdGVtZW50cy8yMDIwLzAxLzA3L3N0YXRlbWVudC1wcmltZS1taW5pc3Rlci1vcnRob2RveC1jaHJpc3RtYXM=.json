As we gather with family and friends, we are reminded of the difference we can make by being kind, open, and considerate wherever we are – at home, work, school, or just around the neighbourhood.</p>\n\n<p>“Christmas is also a time to give generously to the people around us. We can donate to a worthy cause, volunteer at a community event, or lend a hand to a neighbour. During the holiday season, I encourage everyone to live the values of compassion and care that define us as Canadians.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, I invite all Canadians to recognize the important contributions that Orthodox Christians make to our country and our communities. Sophie and I wish all those celebrating today a merry Christmas.”</p></div>\n      "
