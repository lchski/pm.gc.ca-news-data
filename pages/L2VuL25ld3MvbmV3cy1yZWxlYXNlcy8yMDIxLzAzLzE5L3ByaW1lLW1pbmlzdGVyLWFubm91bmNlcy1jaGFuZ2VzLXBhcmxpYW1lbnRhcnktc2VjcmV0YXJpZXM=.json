They also help advance government legislation, engage directly with Canadians on key government initiatives, and represent the government at home and on the international stage.</span></span></span></li>\n\t<li><span><span><span lang=\"EN-CA\" xml:lang=\"EN-CA\">Parliamentary secretaries are not members of Cabinet and do not play a formal role in the Cabinet decision-making process. They support their ministers, but overall responsibility and accountability remains with the minister.</span></span></span></li>\n\t<li><span><span><span lang=\"EN-CA\" xml:lang=\"EN-CA\">The <em>Guide for Parliamentary Secretaries</em> was released publicly for the first time in January 2016. It provides them with key information about their role and responsibilities within Canada’s system of responsible parliamentary government, and outlines the rules and policies that relate to their work as parliamentary secretaries.</span></span></span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><span><span><span lang=\"EN-CA\" xml:lang=\"EN-CA\">Associated Links</span></span></span></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span><span><span lang=\"EN\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https://pm.gc.ca/en/parliamentary-secretaries\">Parliamentary Secretaries</a></span></span></span></li>\n\t<li><span><span><span lang=\"EN\" xml:lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/backgrounders/2016/01/05/guide-parliamentary-secretaries\">Guide for Parliamentary Secretaries</a></span></span></span></li>\n</ul></div>\n      "
