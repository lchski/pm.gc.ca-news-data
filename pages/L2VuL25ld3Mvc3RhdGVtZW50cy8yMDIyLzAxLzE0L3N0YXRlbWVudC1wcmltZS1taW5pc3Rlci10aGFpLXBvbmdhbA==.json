Traditionally, families and friends gather to give thanks for a bountiful harvest and share Pongal, a sweet rice pudding. While festivities may look different again this year as we continue to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, I know Tamil Canadians will find ways to embody the core values of peace, unity, and compassion at the heart of the celebration of Thai Pongal.</p>\n\n<p>“In January, we also mark Tamil Heritage Month in Canada. It is an opportunity for all Canadians to reflect on the rich history, resiliency, and strength of the Tamil community. It is also a time for us to recognize and celebrate the many contributions Tamil Canadians have made, and continue to make, to our country’s social, economic, and cultural fabric. Together, we will build a stronger, fairer, and more inclusive Canada.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating Thai Pongal, here in Canada and around the world, a joyful festival.</p>\n\n<p>“Iniya Thai Pongal Nalvazhthukkal.”</p></div>\n      "
