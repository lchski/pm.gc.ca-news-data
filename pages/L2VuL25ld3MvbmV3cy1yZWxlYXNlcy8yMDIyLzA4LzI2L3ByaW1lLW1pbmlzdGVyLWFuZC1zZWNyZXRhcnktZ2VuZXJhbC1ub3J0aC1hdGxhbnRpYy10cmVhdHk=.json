The leaders also discussed Canada’s recently announced plan to modernize its continental defence, including $38.6 billion over the next 20 years which will bolster NORAD capabilities, and thereby strengthen NATO’s western and northern flanks.</p>\n\n<h2>Quote</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Keeping people safe is our top priority. From helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia’s brutal invasion, to taking ambitious climate action, Canada and NATO are working closely together to advance our shared priorities. Canada will continue to work with NATO and our Allies to fight climate change, improve Arctic defence and security, support Ukraine, and reinforce the rules-based international system. Together, we will build a safer, more peaceful, world for everyone.”</p>\n\n<footer class=\"default\">The Rt. Hon.
