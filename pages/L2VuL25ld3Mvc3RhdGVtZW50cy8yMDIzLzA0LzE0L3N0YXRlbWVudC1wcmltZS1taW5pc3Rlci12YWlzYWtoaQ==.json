From coast to coast to coast, friends and family will also take part in vibrant and colourful Khalsa Day parades.</p>\n\n<p>“Vaisakhi falls during Sikh Heritage Month, which invites all of us to celebrate the culture and heritage of Sikh Canadians – one of the world’s largest Sikh communities outside of India. Across Canada, Sikhs continue to embody the values of equality, generosity, and compassion through seva – selfless service to others. Today, we recognize the significant contributions of Sikh Canadians in making our country stronger, more prosperous, and more diverse.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating a joyful Vaisakhi.</p>\n\n<p>“Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh.”</p></div>\n      "
