Yet too often, this important part of our wellbeing is dismissed or stigmatized, leaving people to suffer in silence. By being open and talking about mental health with others, we can break down the stigma and make sure everyone gets the support they need.</p>\n\n<p>“The Government of Canada is working with provinces, territories, Indigenous communities, and other partners to improve access to mental health services. Past budgets have reinforced this commitment, and helped provide people across the country with the mental health care they need. By working together, we can help make sure all Canadians have access to these vital health care services.</p>\n\n<p>“We’ve all been affected by mental health, whether we know someone who has experienced a mental health issue or whether we’ve gone through these struggles ourselves. There is no shame in struggling with a mental health issue. Today and every day, let’s work to end stigma and make sure everyone has the support they need.”</p></div>\n      "
