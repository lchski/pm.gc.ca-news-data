Her efforts brought national attention to adult literacy, helped reduce stigma for adult learners, and provided Canadians with essential tools and resources to support their learning goals.</p>\n\n<p>“In 2015, she was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada for her distinguished career and her dedication to improving the lives of Canadians. In 2018, the Senator Joyce Fairbairn Middle School in Lethbridge was duly named in her honour.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I extend our deepest condolences to Senator Fairbairn’s family and friends – we are grieving with you. She was a true champion for Canadians and will be dearly missed.”</p></div>\n      "
