We also honour the survivors still with us today, and pledge to keep their memories alive for generations to come.</p><p>“As the years pass, and Holocaust survivors become fewer, our task becomes even more urgent. We must never forget humanity’s capacity for deliberate evil and destruction, and the dangers of anti-Semitism, indifference, and silence in the face of atrocity. Survivors’ stories must be told, and retold.</p><p>“Words too often stand in the place of action. When we vow, ‘Never again’, we recommit ourselves to a world that goes beyond tolerance and learns to love its differences. We pledge to always speak out against racism and hate, and stand on guard against a resurgence of anti-Semitism and xenophobia.</p><p>“Today, I encourage Canadians to reflect on the bitter lessons of the Holocaust, and share the stories of those whose lives were tragically lost and those who survived the unspeakable. We must never forget.”</p></div>\n      "
