It is a time of renewal for Coptic Christians, who come together to exchange gifts and pray as a community.</p><p>“Tracing their ancestry to the ancient Egyptians, Coptic Christians have successfully preserved their rich faith and traditions, including Nayrouz, throughout the centuries. Today, Coptic Christian communities are found around the world.</p><p>“As we celebrate the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Confederation this year, I invite Canadians to reflect on the diverse faiths and cultural communities that have chosen to make this country home.
