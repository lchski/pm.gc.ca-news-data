Whether they work behind the scenes or on the front lines of the pandemic, these dedicated professionals play an essential role every day in our country’s health care system.</p>\n\n<p>“Our medical laboratory professionals provide invaluable and life-saving contributions to the health and well-being of all Canadians by processing, analyzing, and documenting test samples. They provide crucial data to guide diagnoses, treatments, and patient care for everything from cancer to COVID-19.</p>\n\n<p>“Since the beginning of the pandemic, close to 60 million COVID-19 tests have been performed in Canada, and efforts continue to trace, treat, and monitor the disease. Along with other health care and front-line workers, medical laboratory professionals have gone above and beyond to help save lives and protect Canadians from coast to coast to coast, and we thank them for their dedication.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, I invite everyone to take a moment to show appreciation for the invaluable work our medical laboratory professionals have done – and continue to do – to save lives and protect Canadians across the country.”</p></div>\n      "
