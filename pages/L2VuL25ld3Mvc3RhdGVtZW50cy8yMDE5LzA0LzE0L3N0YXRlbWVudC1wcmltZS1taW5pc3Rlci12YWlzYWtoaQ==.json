It celebrates the creation of the Khalsa Panth – the community of baptized Sikhs – by Guru Gobind Singh Ji in 1699. This year is also a special year for Sikhs, as it marks the 550th anniversary of the birth of the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak Dev Ji.</p>\n\n<p>“To mark the occasion, family and friends will gather in Gurdwaras to pray and read sacred texts, and take part in parades, or Nagar Kirtans.</p>\n\n<p>“Sikhism is rooted in teachings of equality, unity, selfless service, and social justice. For over a century, Sikh Canadians have shown us the best of those values, and put them into practice to build a better Canada.</p>\n\n<p>“Vaisakhi is an opportunity to recognize the immense contributions that Sikhs have made to our country, and to celebrate more than 120 years of Sikh history in our communities. Canada is proud to be home to one of the largest Sikh populations in the world.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating a joyful Vaisakhi.</p>\n\n<p>“Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh.”</p></div>\n      "
