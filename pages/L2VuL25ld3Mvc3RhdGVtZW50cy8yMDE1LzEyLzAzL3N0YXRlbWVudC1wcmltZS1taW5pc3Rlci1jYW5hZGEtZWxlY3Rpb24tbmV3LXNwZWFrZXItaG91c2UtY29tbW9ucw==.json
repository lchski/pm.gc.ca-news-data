In the coming weeks, we will work hard on promoting greater openness and transparency across government.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We have already taken important steps towards this goal, including by making ministerial mandate letters public which set out expectations for the conduct of Ministers and their roles and responsibilities. We will be undertaking further reforms in short order.</p>\n<p>“I congratulate Geoff Regan again on his election to the position and look forward to working with him – and all Members of the House of Commons – during the 42<sup>nd</sup> Parliament to build a better Canada.”</p></div>\n      "
