Far too many women and girls continue to face injustices and discrimination.</p>\n<p>It is unacceptable that in 2016, women are still denied an education, forced into an early marriage, or made victims of gender-based violence. As leaders, as parents, as community members, upholding women’s rights should be – and must be – a priority for us all.</p>\n<p>“Canada’s theme for this year‘s International Women’s Day – <em>Women’s Empowerment Leads to Equality</em> – reminds us that we all benefit when women and girls have the opportunities and the resources they need to succeed.</p>\n<p>“We remain committed to advancing gender equality, so that Canada can become a country where all women and girls can reach their full potential.</p>\n<p>“Today, I encourage all Canadians to join me in celebrating International Women’s Day. I also urge you to take part in the Government of Canada #YouAreEmpowerment campaign to honour a woman who has inspired you.”&nbsp;</p></div>\n      "
