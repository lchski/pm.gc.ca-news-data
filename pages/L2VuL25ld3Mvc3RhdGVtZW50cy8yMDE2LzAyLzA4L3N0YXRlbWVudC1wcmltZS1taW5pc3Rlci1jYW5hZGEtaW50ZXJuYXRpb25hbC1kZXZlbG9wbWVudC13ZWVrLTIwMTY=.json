Nowhere are these qualities more evident than in our international development workers and volunteers. These Canadians work tirelessly at home – and around the world – to reduce poverty and inequality.</p>\n<p>“Moving forward, the Government of Canada will be refocusing development assistance on helping the world’s poorest and most vulnerable. Our efforts will be guided by the principles of innovation and effectiveness, as we strive to make Canada’s approach to development something that we can all be proud of.</p>\n<p>“During International Development Week, I encourage all Canadians to learn – and draw inspiration from – those who do so much to make our world a safer and more compassionate place to live.”</p></div>\n      "
