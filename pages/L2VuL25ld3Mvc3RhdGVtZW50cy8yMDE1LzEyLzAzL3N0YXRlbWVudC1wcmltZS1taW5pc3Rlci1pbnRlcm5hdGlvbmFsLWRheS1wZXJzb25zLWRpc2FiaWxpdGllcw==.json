Too often, persons with disabilities are confronted with stigma, discrimination and, ultimately, denied the most basic human rights. We will work to ensure the full diversity of Canadians is reflected in their government and in its decisions.</p>\n<p>“This day serves as an important reminder to us all of the determination shown on a daily basis by persons with disabilities in their quest for inclusion and equal treatment. It is also an occasion to become more educated about what we can do to promote and advocate for persons with disabilities.</p>\n<p>“We have a duty to help eliminate the systemic barriers that persist in our society, and we will work with the provinces, territories and others to make sure that all Canadians have equality of opportunity.”</p></div>\n      "
