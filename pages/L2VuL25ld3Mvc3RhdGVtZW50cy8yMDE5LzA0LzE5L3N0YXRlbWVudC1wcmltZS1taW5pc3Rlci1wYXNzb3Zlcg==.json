It celebrates freedom, the power of hope, and the immense perseverance of the Jewish people. The Passover story reminds us that each of us can be a voice for justice, and use our courage to change the world.</p>\n\n<p>“This holiday is also a chance to celebrate Canada’s Jewish community, and the major role that Jewish Canadians have always played in shaping our country for the better. We will always stand together against anti-Semitism and hatred in all its forms, and work together to make our world a better one.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish peace, health, and joy to all those celebrating.</p>\n\n<p>“Chag Pesach Sameach!<em>”</em></p></div>\n      "
