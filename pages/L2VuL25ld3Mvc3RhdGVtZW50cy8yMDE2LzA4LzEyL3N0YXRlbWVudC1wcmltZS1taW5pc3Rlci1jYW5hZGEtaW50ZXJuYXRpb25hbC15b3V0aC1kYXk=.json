These global challenges demand fresh thinking and renewed vision. No one is ever too young to be a leader, and seek the answers that could combat climate change, build fairer, more inclusive societies, and change the world.</p>\n<p>“Canadian youth have innovative ideas and new perspectives on how we should address the opportunities and challenges of our day. That is why we established the Prime Minister’s Youth Council to ensure we hear, at the highest level of government, what young people have to say. Youth issues are everyone’s issues, and youth should have a voice in decisions that will affect them for the rest of their lives.</p>\n<p>“On this day, and every day, I encourage young people to initiate and lead the change we seek and need now. Be the leaders of today. There is no reason to wait until tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I wish all those marking the occasion a happy and inspiring International Youth Day.”</p></div>\n      "
