This pact, signed in 1939 between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, allowed for the illegal political and territorial rearrangement of Eastern and Central Europe.</p>\n<p>“In the years that followed, millions of people were robbed of their homes and suffered untold atrocities at the hands of the Soviet and Nazi regimes.</p>\n<p>“Many of those who came to Canada to escape these regimes still bear the scars of the unspeakable acts committed against them and their loved ones. These Canadians and their descendants have made remarkable contributions to our country, and continue to strengthen our national fabric. We must never forget their stories.</p>\n<p>“Today, we express solidarity with all victims of totalitarian regimes and reiterate Canada’s unwavering commitment to the principles of justice, democracy, and universal human rights. We remember this dark period of history to ensure that the world never again lets such tyranny go unopposed.”</p></div>\n      "
