I would like to extend our sincerest appreciation for their support.</p>\n<p>“I would also like to recognize the cooperation of those Iranian authorities who facilitated her release and repatriation. They understand that cases like these impede more productive relations.</p>\n<p>“We ask all to respect the family’s wish for privacy at this time.”</p></div>\n      "
