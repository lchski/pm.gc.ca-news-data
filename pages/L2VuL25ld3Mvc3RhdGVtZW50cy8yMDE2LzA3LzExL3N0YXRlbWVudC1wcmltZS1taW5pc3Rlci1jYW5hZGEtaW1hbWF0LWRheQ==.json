His achievements and contributions toward improving the lives of some of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people are immeasurable.</p>\n<p>“Above all, he has demonstrated the importance of being a good global citizen and the value of helping others, regardless of their origin or religion, to reach their full potential.</p>\n<p>“The values promoted by the Aga Khan—pluralism, compassion, inclusion, respect for diversity, and human rights—are those that we as Canadians hold dear, and we are honoured to call him a friend, and to host here in Canada both the Global Centre for Pluralism and the only Islamic Museum in North America—the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto.</p>\n<p>“On this day, we thank the Aga Khan for being a true humanitarian, and for inspiring us all to show more kindness and generosity of heart to others.</p>\n<p>“<em>Kushiali Mubarak</em>.”</p></div>\n      "
