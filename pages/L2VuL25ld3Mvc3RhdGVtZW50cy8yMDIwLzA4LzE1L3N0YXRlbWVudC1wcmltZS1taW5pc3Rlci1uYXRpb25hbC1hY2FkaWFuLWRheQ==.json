Despite all the hardships and challenges they have faced, Acadians have succeeded in building a unique identity and thriving communities. The spirited Acadian culture, which today is demonstrated across all sectors and fields, inspires millions of people far beyond our country’s borders.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“This year, because of COVID-19, many Acadians will be unable to take to the streets for the Grand Tintamarre, as they usually do. But I am delighted to see that virtual tintamarres and other events have been organized all across Canada and around the world. For example, tonight we have been promised a virtual road trip of music and poetry that will take us to Moncton, Caraquet, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and other Acadian communities.</p>\n\n<p>“Although people will be staying home and following public health guidelines, there are still plenty of opportunities for Acadians to celebrate, and show that the spirit of Acadia is alive and well.</p>\n\n<p>“With four hundred years of history in this land we now call Canada, Acadians have always been an integral part of our country’s character. On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating today a very happy National Acadian Day.”</p></div>\n      "
