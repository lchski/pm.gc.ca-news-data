Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected, and we hope and pray that those injured have a complete and rapid recovery.</p><p>“Today’s senseless attacks targeted churchgoers attending Palm Sunday services, which mark the Sunday before Easter and the start of Holy Week for Christians. Let us remember that the palm branches used in services around the world today are a symbol of peace.</p><p>“Canada stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Egypt and the Egyptian people, and we offer our full assistance to the Government of Egypt in this difficult time.</p><p>“Far too often, religious groups around the world suffer persecution and discrimination at the hands of violent extremists.
