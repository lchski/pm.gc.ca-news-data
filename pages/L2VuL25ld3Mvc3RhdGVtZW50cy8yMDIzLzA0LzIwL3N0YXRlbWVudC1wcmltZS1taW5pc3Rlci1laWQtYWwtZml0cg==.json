It is an opportunity for families and friends to spend quality time together, worship as a community, and give to charity.

Canada’s cultural diversity is one of our greatest strengths and sources of pride.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish a happy and blessed Eid al-Fitr to all those celebrating.</p>\n\n<p>\"!عيد مبارك</p>\n\n<p>“Eid Mubarak!”</p></div>\n      "
