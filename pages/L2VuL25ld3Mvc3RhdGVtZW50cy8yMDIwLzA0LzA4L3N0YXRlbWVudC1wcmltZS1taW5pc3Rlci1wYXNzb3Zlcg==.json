This year is different, as Canadians and people around the world deal with the impacts of the COVID‑19 pandemic. Please follow the recommendations of our public health experts, and stay at home. If you have to go out, remember to keep a safe distance of at least two metres from others to keep yourselves and your loved ones safe.</p>\n\n<p>“Passover is a time to recognize the power of hope and the strength and perseverance of the Jewish people, who have prevailed in the face of unspeakable persecution. It also reminds us that we must always stand together against antisemitism, hatred, and discrimination, wherever they occur.</p>\n\n<p>“On this occasion, I invite all Canadians to recognize the important contributions that Jewish Canadians – past and present – have made to our country. On behalf of our family, Sophie and I extend our best wishes to everyone celebrating Passover.</p>\n\n<p>“Chag Pesach Sameach.<em>”</em></p></div>\n      "
