To celebrate, friends and families join together to sing, dance, eat delicacies, light bonfires, and paint each other with brightly coloured powders and dyes.&nbsp;</p><p>“While a joyous occasion, Holi also allows for more serious reflection on the traditional notions of good and evil, and the ultimate triumph of light over darkness. It is also an opportunity to renew and strengthen friendships, and look to the year ahead with optimism and hope.</p><p>“Holi is celebrated by Hindus and non-Hindus alike in many parts of the world, including here in Canada. These celebrations remind us that our diversity is our greatest strength. Today, we take time to recognize the tremendous contributions that Canadians of Hindu faith make to our country, and reaffirm our commitment to building a stronger, more prosperous, and more inclusive Canada. &nbsp;</p><p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish all those celebrating Holi a fun-filled, happy, and colourful festival.</p><p>“<i>Holi Hai!</i>”</p></div>\n      "
