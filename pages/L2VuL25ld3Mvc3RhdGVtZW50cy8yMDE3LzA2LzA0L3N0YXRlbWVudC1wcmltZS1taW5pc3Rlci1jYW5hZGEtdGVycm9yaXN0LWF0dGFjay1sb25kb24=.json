I am heartbroken that a Canadian is among those killed. </span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">“We grieve with the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones, and wish all those injured a speedy and full recovery.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">\"Londoners and people across the United Kingdom have always displayed strength and resilience in the face of adversity.

This time will be no different. </span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">“These hateful acts do not deter us; they only strengthen our resolve. Canadians stand united with the British people.
