The Prime Minister noted that, given our shared history, it is inconceivable that Canadian steel or aluminum might be a security threat to the U.S.&nbsp; He stressed that these tariffs will hurt workers and industry on both sides of the Canada-U.S. border.</p><p>The Prime Minister thanked Canadian premiers for their hard work and continued support in advocating against the unwarranted tariffs. The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of the steel and aluminum sector to the Canadian economy, and First Ministers agreed to continue to vigorously defend and protect Canadian workers, industry, and interests.
