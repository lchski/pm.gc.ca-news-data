In a year where we have seen inequalities compounded by the effects of a global pandemic, His Highness has continued to work to help reduce poverty, advance gender equality, and improve health care and education. Whether through his <a href=\"https://www.pluralism.ca/\">Global Centre for Pluralism</a> in Canada or the <a href=\"https://www.akdn.org/\">Aga Khan Development Network</a>, his tireless efforts have helped make Canada, and the world, more inclusive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“The Aga Khan shares many of the values Canadians hold dear, including kindness, compassion, and respect for diversity. In a world often fraught with division, His Highness has continually worked to bring people together. His unwavering dedication to helping others is an inspiration to us all. For these reasons, he was named an honorary Canadian citizen and invested as an honorary Companion of the Order of Canada.</p>\n\n<p>“Today, Sophie and I thank the Aga Khan for his outstanding leadership. We wish him continued health and happiness on this special day and for years to come.</p>\n\n<p>“Salgirah Khushiali Mubarak!”</p></div>\n      "
