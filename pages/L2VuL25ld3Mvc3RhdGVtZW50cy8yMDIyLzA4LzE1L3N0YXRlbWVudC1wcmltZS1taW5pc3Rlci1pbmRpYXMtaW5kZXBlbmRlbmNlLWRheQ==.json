Today is an occasion to reflect on the tremendous impact India’s people, history, and culture have had around the world since 1947. We join the people of India and Indo-Canadian communities to celebrate this milestone anniversary.</p>\n\n<p>“Canada and India have a strong, longstanding, and vibrant relationship built on shared values like democracy, and deep people-to-people ties, with over 1.4 million people of Indian heritage calling Canada home. Their many important contributions have made, and continue to make, our country stronger, more diverse, and inclusive.</p>\n\n<p>“Today, our two countries work closely together in a range of priority areas, including science and technology, finance, and education. We also share common interests in advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific region, fighting climate change, and strengthening global trade. We will continue to strengthen our partnership for the benefit of people in Canada and India.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I extend our best wishes to all those celebrating India’s Independence Day here in Canada and around the world.”</p></div>\n      "
