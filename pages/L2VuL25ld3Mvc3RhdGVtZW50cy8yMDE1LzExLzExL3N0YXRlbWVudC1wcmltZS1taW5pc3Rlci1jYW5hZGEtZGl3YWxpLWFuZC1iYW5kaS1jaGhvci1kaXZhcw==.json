Known as the Festival of Lights to many, Diwali is also a celebration of the power of higher knowledge and light to dispel ignorance.</p>\n<p>“This holiday, which stands as an example of Canadian diversity, gives us the occasion&nbsp; to reflect on the important contributions of all our citizens. Diwali highlights our shared values of respect and inclusion, and our commitment to freedom and equality. It is a reminder that Canada is a nation made stronger not in spite of our differences, but because of them.</p>\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I wish a very happy Diwali and Bandi Chhor Divas to all those observing these holidays with their family and loved ones.”</p></div>\n      "
