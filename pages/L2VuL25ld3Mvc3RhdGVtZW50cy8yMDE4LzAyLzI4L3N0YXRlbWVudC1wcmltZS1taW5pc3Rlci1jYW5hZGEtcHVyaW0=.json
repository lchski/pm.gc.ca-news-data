Loved ones will also gather to enjoy traditional foods, including pastries like hamantaschen.</p><p>“Purim commemorates the escape of the Jews from persecution in the ancient Persian Empire. This story – Esther’s courage, the king’s compassion, the perseverance of the Jewish people – is a reminder that hope, and love, can triumph over hatred.</p><p>“Purim is a chance to honour Canada’s Jewish community, and the significant contributions Jewish Canadians make to our country. I invite all Canadians to reflect on the lessons of Purim and celebrate the diversity that makes us strong.</p><p>“Today, we also reaffirm our ongoing responsibility to stand together against anti-Semitism, hatred, and discrimination in Canada and around the world.</p><p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I wish all those celebrating a joyful Purim.</p><p>“Chag Purim Sameach!”</p></div>\n      "
