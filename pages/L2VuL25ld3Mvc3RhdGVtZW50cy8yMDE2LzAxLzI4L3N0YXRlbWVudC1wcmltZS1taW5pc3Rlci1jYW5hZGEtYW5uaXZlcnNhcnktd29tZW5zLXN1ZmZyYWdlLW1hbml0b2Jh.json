While we have made progress towards gender equality, we still have a lot of hard work to do. We know that far too many women in Canada – and around the world – continue to face discrimination.</p>\n<p>“These brave suffragettes led by example then, and they continue to inspire us now – all Canadians, women and men alike, should be proud to call themselves feminists. We remain committed to advancing gender equality so that our society is one where all women and girls can reach their full potential.</p>\n<p>“Together, we can, and will, continue to push for true equality between men and women, right here in Canada and around the world.”</p></div>\n      "
