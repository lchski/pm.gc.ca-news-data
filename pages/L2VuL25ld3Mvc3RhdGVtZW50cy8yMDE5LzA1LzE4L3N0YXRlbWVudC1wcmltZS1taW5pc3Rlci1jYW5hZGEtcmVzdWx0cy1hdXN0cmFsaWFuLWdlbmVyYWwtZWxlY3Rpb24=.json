He is now entrusted with the important task of forming the next government of Australia.</p>\n\n<p>“I look forward to working closely with Mr. Morrison to address issues of importance to Canadians and Australians, including promoting free and open global trade, fighting climate change, and eliminating violent extremism.</p>\n\n<p>“Canada and Australia enjoy a lasting friendship built on historic ties and shared values. We are close partners in the Asia-Pacific region, and were among the first countries to adopt the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership—an agreement that is creating good, middle class jobs and new opportunities for people in both our countries.</p>\n\n<p>“Our two countries collaborate closely through organizations like the United Nations, the Commonwealth, the G20, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. We stand united in defense of global institutions, standards, and rules. We are also steadfast partners in the fight against terrorism and violent extremism, and in the promotion of greater peace and stability around the world.</p>\n\n<p>“Together, we will make our relationship even stronger, and continue to create new opportunities for Australians and Canadians alike.”</p></div>\n      "
