As we reflect on Jesus’s message of compassion, we ask ourselves what more we can do to spread kindness and make our world a better one.</p>\n\n<p>“Today, though, we woke up to devastating news of attacks on Christians at prayer in Sri Lanka. Our places of worship are sacred. Freedom of religion is a right. In the wake of these attacks, we will come together, resolved to take care of each other and make sure everyone can practice their faith in safety and freedom.</p>\n\n<p>“At home in Canada, Easter is also a chance to celebrate the major contributions Christians make to our communities each day. This spring, and throughout the year, let’s appreciate everything that brings us together, and put into practice what it means to love our neighbours as ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish all those celebrating a joyful and blessed Easter.”</p></div>\n      "
