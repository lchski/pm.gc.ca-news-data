By hosting the Replenishment Conference, Canada is once more defining itself as a nation committed to helping those most in need – both at home and around the world.</p>\n<p>The conference aims to help raise USD $ 13 billion, for 2017 to 2019, to support the Global Fund in fighting three of the world’s most deadly diseases. It will bring together donor and recipient governments, the private sector, private foundations, civil society, and affected communities in an effort to end AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria as epidemics by 2030.</p>\n<p>During the Conference, Canada will highlight the pressing need to help women and girls who often must bear a disproportionate amount of the burden caused by AIDS and malaria, and who assume significant additional responsibilities for those affected by tuberculosis.</p>\n<p>Canada has pledged $785 million, for 2017 to 2019, to help the Global Fund save an additional 8 million lives and stop an additional 300 million new infections by 2019.</p>\n<p><strong><br>Quotes</strong></p>\n<p>“The world has made tremendous progress on diseases that seemed unstoppable only 15 years ago. We are close to ending the HIV, TB, and malaria epidemics for good. But to end these diseases – as epidemics – by 2030, we need to do more: more action, more leadership, more smart investments, more innovative thinking, more practical solutions, and more commitment. That is what will bring everyone together in Montréal.”<br><em>—Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada</em></p>\n<p>“We cannot make meaningful advances in development when people are sick and dying from diseases that we can prevent. That is why Canada’s leadership around global health aims to reach the poorest and most vulnerable, especially women and girls. By focusing our efforts to improve the lives of those who are often forgotten or left behind, like adolescent girls, we can help end AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria for good.”<br><em>—</em>&nbsp;<em>Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of International Development and La Francophonie</em></p>\n<p><strong><br>Quick Facts</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Replenishment Session will be held on September 16, at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, Montréal, Quebec.</li>\n<li>The Leaders' conference will be held on September 17, at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Montréal, Quebec.</li>\n<li>Usher, Half Moon Run, Metric, Grimes, and Charlotte Cardin will headline a concert on Saturday, September 17, at the Bell Centre in Montreal to celebrate progress in global health and development.
