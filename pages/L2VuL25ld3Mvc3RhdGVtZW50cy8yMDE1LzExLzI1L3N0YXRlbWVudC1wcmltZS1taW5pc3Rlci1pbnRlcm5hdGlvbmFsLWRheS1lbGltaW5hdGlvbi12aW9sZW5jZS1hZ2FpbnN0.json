It destroys lives, tears families apart, impacts entire communities, and has no place within our society.</p>\n<p>“Today serves as an important reminder that women and girls – particularly indigenous women and girls – continue to be vulnerable to violence in our society. This must change.</p>\n<p>“That is why the Government of Canada will continue to raise awareness of violence against women, help prevent it, and support the victims who have experienced it, both here at home and around the world.</p>\n<p>“As leaders, as parents, as community members, we need to make sure we are combating misogyny in all its forms, wherever it is found.</p>\n<p>“On this day, I urge all Canadians to make a commitment to stopping violence against women and girls. You can start by taking the online pledge to #EndViolence at <a href=\"http://swc-cfc.gc.ca/index-en.html\">women.gc.ca</a></p>\n<p>“Together, we can create a Canada and a world where all citizens are respected, valued equally, and safe from violence.”</p></div>\n      "
