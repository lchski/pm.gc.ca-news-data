On the streets of Israel, sirens will sound as an entire nation pauses to remember, while the Mourner’s Kaddish will echo through synagogues around the world.</p><p>“These moments of reflection and remembrance are vital. We cannot let the horrors of the Holocaust fade, and forget the dangers of anti-Semitism, indifference, and silence. Every generation must know what happened, and restate the values we hold dear, to bring meaning to the solemn vow, ‘Never again.’</p><p>“These are not just words but a call to action: A call to always speak out against racism, hate, and bigotry in all its forms. And to stand on guard against a resurgence of anti-Semitism, xenophobia, and prejudice.</p><p>“On behalf of Sophie and our family, I extend my thoughts and prayers to all those observing Yom HaShoah.”</p></div>\n      "
