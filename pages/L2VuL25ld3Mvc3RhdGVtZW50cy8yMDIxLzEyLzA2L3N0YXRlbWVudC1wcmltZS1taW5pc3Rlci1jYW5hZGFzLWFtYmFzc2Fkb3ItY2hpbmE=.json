He offered support and counsel to the two Michaels’ families and he worked to forge a coalition of like-minded countries to stand in solidarity. Thanks to Dominic’s leadership and skilled diplomatic approach, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are back at home with their families.</p>\n\n<p>“Dominic has also played an integral role in shaping and pursuing Canada’s priorities with respect to China. Thanks to his efforts, Canada is now better positioned to manage this important relationship and achieve our diplomatic objectives.</p>\n\n<p>“Dominic, my friend, thank you for your work and dedication to our country and to the people of Canada.</p>\n\n<p>“Canada is stronger because of your service, and I wish you all the best.”</p></div>\n      "
