They have stood together for centuries, and this continues today. This enduring solidarity is evident in the ‘ça va bien aller’ – everything will be all right – slogan that has helped bring us together since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>“Outside Quebec, Francophones in minority situations maintain the vibrancy of the French language and culture. Our government has always been – and will continue to be – an ally. We stepped up to help the Université de l’Ontario français become a reality, because we know that this institution will make an important contribution to the education of young Francophones in the years to come.</p>\n\n<p>“The presence of Francophones in every province and territory is a reminder to all Canadians of the rightful place of the French language in this country. It is also a reminder that French will always be at the heart of Canada’s past, present and future.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, I extend my best wishes to all Francophones and Francophiles celebrating Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day.”</p></div>\n      "
