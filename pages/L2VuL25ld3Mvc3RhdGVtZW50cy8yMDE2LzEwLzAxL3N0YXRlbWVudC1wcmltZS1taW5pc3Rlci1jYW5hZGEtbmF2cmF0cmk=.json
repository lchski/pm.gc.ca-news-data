This year, it takes place at the beginning of October, around harvest time.</p>\n<p>“To mark this occasion, families and loved ones gather over nine nights to worship, dance, and celebrate, culminating in the tenth night of festivities. This festival is celebrated by Hindus and non-Hindus alike across Canada, India, and around the world.</p>\n<p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I invite all Canadians to reflect on the important contributions of Canada’s Hindu community to our national fabric, and extend our warmest regards to everyone celebrating Navratri.”</p></div>\n      "
