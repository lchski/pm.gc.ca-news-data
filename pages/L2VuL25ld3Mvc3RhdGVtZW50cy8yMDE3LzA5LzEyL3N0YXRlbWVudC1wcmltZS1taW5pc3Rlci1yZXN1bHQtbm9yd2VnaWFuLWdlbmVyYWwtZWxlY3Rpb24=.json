This closely-contested election was a testament to the strength and dynamism of Norway’s democracy.</p><p>“Canada will continue to work with the international community, including Norway, to promote democracy, good governance, and human rights, and advance initiatives that address the needs of all our citizens as they adapt to a rapidly changing world. As members of the Arctic Council, Canada and Norway also have a particular responsibility to address climate change and support sustainable development in the Arctic region.</p><p>“Relations between our two countries were forged during the Second World War, when thousands of exiled Norwegian military personnel trained in Canada for the eventual liberation of their homeland. Since that time, Norway and Canada have become close economic partners and firm NATO allies. Our two countries are committed to values of equality, democracy, and human rights. Together we promote these values abroad in the UN and other organizations. Our relationship will continue to expand and develop as we face the future together.”</p></div>\n      "
