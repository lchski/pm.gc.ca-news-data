He stood as a model for courageous engagement in the face of intractable global challenges.</p>\n<p>“Helmut Schmidt was a great friend to Canada, and to my father. I had the great fortune to meet him a few times when I was younger, and I will never forget the visit he made to my father’s grave in St-Rémi-de-Napierville in 2011.</p>\n<p>“Canada greatly values its enduring relationship with Germany. We share with the German people their sense of loss of a great statesman.”</p></div>\n      "
