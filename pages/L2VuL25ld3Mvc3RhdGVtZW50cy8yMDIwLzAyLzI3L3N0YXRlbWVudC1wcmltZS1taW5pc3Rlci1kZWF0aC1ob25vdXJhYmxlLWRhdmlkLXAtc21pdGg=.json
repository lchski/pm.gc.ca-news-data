Smith:</p>\n\n<p>“I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of David P. Smith, the former Senator and Member of Parliament.</p>\n\n<p>“David had a lifelong passion for politics. He worked his entire life to support a strong and healthy democracy, and to help others who aspired to public office. He understood that the most precious thing a Member of Parliament could earn is the trust of Canadians. It is a testament to his wisdom and good humour that he was respected and liked by people of all political stripes.</p>\n\n<p>“From his work on the Hill to his time on Toronto City Council, the House of Commons, and the Senate, David dedicated himself to building a better, more inclusive Canada. A true champion of equality, David’s proudest legacy was his work to have the rights of people with disabilities included in the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I offer our condolences to his family and friends.”</p></div>\n      "
