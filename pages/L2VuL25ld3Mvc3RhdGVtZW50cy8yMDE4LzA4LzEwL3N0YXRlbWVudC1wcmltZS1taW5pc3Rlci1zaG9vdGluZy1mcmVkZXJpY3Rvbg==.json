We mourn with everyone who has lost a friend, colleague, or family member, and wish those injured a speedy and full recovery.</p><p>“There is no greater gesture than to put oneself in harm’s way to protect the life of another. This morning, first responders rushed to the scene of danger. They did not think twice about what they had to do to keep their fellow Canadians safe. They were unflinching in their duty. We will not forget the two fallen police officers whose sacrifice no doubt saved lives and prevented even greater tragedy.</p><p>“The RCMP is giving its full support to the Fredericton Police, who are investigating the shooting. I have spoken with the Fredericton Chief of Police Leanne Fitch, Mayor Mike O’Brien, and the Premier of New Brunswick Brian Gallant and offered my condolences on behalf of the Government of Canada. We are monitoring the situation closely, and stand ready to assist in any way we can.</p><p>“The people of Fredericton are courageous, strong, and resilient. Canadians stand with you during this difficult time.”</p></div>\n      "
