It is a time to celebrate peace, renew and strengthen friendships, and look to the new season ahead with optimism and joy. It is also an opportunity to reflect on the traditional notions of good and evil and the triumph of light over darkness.</p>\n\n<p>“On this occasion, family and friends will sing and dance, share seasonal delicacies, and paint each other with brightly coloured powders and dyes.</p>\n\n<p>“Holi is one of the most celebrated festivals in South Asia, and in many parts of the world. Here in Canada, these celebrations are a reminder that diversity and inclusion build stronger and more vibrant communities. They are also an opportunity to recognize the important contributions Canadians of Hindu faith make to our country every day.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I wish a fun, colourful, and joyous festival to everyone celebrating.</p>\n\n<p>“Holi Hai!”</p></div>\n      "
