While celebrations may look different again this year as we continue to follow public health guidelines to keep everyone safe, this anniversary remains a time for Sikh communities to reflect on Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s teachings of compassion, inclusion, and equality.</p>\n\n<p>“Over the past year and a half, we have seen Sikh Canadians across the country embody these values. They have shown incredible generosity by being there for their communities through seva – selfless service. They have made food for people in need, distributed care packages for neighbours, and sewn masks for seniors in long-term care homes.</p>\n\n<p>“Canada is proudly home to one of the largest Sikh populations in the world. Today, I encourage all Canadians to reflect on the important contributions Sikh Canadians make to our country, as we work to create a better future for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I offer our best wishes to everyone celebrating the birth of Guru Nanak Dev Ji today.”</p></div>\n      "
