Time and time again, Canadians in uniform have gone into harm’s way to protect us and defend everything our country stands for. They have sacrificed their time, their physical and mental health, and, too often, their lives to help keep others safe and secure.</p><p>“We owe a debt of gratitude to these extraordinary Canadians, and they deserve the best possible training, care, and support. Canada’s new defence policy – <i>Strong, Secure, Engaged</i> – establishes a credible, realistic, and funded strategy for our military and, most importantly, will deliver the standard of service and care our Canadians in uniform deserve.</p><p>“As we salute Canada’s bravest, we also honour their loved ones and families. Military families deal with unique anxieties and challenges – from long separations, to frequent relocations, to the inherent risk that accompanies all those who serve. We are grateful for their sacrifice and enduring support.</p><p>“Today, I join all Canadians to thank past and present members of the Canadian Armed Forces and their families for their profound service and sense of duty. We honour these brave Canadians and all those who laid down their lives so we might live in a freer, safer, and more hopeful world.”</p></div>\n      "
