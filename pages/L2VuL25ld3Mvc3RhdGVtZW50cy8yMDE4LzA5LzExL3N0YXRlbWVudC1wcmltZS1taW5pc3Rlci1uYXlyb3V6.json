Also known as the Feast of Rivers, this festival marks the first day of Thout, the first month of the Coptic year.</p><p>“Celebrations of Nayrouz can be traced back to ancient Egypt, when Coptic Christians were persecuted under Roman rule because of their faith. Nayrouz is a time to reflect on the deep history of the Copts, to worship, and to spend time with loved ones.</p><p>“Coptic Christians have carried their religion and traditions for generations, and today, their communities reflect on the past and celebrate the year to come. For all of us, Nayrouz is a time to honour the many contributions Coptic Christians make to our country, and celebrate the values that make us strong – from the freedom to worship in peace and safety, to openness, inclusion, and freedom of expression.</p><p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating a happy Nayrouz!”</p></div>\n      "
