The Mid-Autumn Festival is also a time to celebrate the importance of family, to give thanks for the successes of the past year, and to look to the year ahead with optimism.</p>\n\n<p>“Today, we celebrate and reflect on the diversity that Canada represents. Guided by their shared values of respect, generosity, and caring, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, and Japanese Canadians are making life better for our communities. This is an opportunity to come together and discover the traditions that make our communities richer and more diverse.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating a happy Mid-Autumn Festival.”</p></div>\n      "
