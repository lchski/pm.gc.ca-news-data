In the early 1600s, Acadians established the first French settlements in what would eventually become Canada. Since then, Acadians have played a significant role in shaping the country we all call home.</p>\n<p>“Despite many hardships, Acadians have showed strength in maintaining their distinct identity over the centuries. Their determination and resilience have been visible throughout history, and have preserved a vibrant culture, a rich set of customs, and a beautiful language that continue to enrich our country today.</p>\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I invite all Canadians to learn more about the Acadia of past and present, and wish all those celebrating today a happy and memorable National Acadian Day.”</p></div>\n      "
