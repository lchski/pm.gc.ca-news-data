He was a champion of the Métis Nation, a defender of minority rights, and the founder of Manitoba. Louis Riel’s vision of a just and equal province showed the way to a better, more inclusive country.</p>\n\n<p>“Today, we are working in partnership with the Métis Nation to make progress on its priorities, including through the <a href=\"https://pm.gc.ca/en/canada-metis-nation-accord\">Canada-Métis Nation Accord</a> and <a href=\"https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2019/06/13/canada-and-metis-nation-continue-progress-canada-metis-nation-accord\">annual Crown-Métis Nation Summit</a> meetings. The Government of Canada has made historic investments to support a Métis Nation-led post-secondary education strategy, recognize the contributions of Métis veterans during the Second World War, and address the housing needs of Métis communities. We will continue to work with the Métis Nation to make a real difference in the lives of Métis people.</p>\n\n<p>“As we prepare to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Métis Nation entering Confederation, I encourage all Canadians to reflect on the essential role the Métis people have played – and continue to play – to build a better Canada.”</p></div>\n      "
