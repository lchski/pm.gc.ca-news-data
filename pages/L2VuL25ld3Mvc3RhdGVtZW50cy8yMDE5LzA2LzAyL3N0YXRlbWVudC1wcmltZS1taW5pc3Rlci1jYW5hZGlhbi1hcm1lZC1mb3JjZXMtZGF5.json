Whether deployed in combat or peace operations, or during disaster relief efforts, they represent the very best of what it means to be Canadian.</p>\n\n<p>“The weight of military service can take a toll on people who wear the uniform. It can also be challenging for families and loved ones. Their enduring support and sacrifice are a tremendous source of strength to our armed forces, and we all owe an immeasurable debt of gratitude to these exceptional Canadians.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, I thank past and present members of the Canadian Armed Forces and their families for their invaluable service and sacrifice, so that we can enjoy peace, freedom, and democracy.”</p></div>\n      "
