To usher in the new season, families will sing and dance, eat delicacies, light bonfires, and paint each other with brightly coloured powders and dyes.</p>\n<p>“This happy holiday is an opportunity to renew friendships and celebrate peace, but it is also a time to reflect on traditional notions of good and evil, and the ultimate triumph of light over darkness. It is a festival that is celebrated by Hindus and non-Hindus alike across Canada, South Asia, and around the world.</p>\n<p>“As friends and families come together for this joyous occasion, we must take a moment to recognize the tremendous contributions Canadians of Hindu faith have made to our country. Our diversity is our greatest strength.</p>\n<p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish all those marking this occasion a fun, happy and colourful Holi.”</p>\n<p>“<em>Holi Hai!</em>”</p></div>\n      "
