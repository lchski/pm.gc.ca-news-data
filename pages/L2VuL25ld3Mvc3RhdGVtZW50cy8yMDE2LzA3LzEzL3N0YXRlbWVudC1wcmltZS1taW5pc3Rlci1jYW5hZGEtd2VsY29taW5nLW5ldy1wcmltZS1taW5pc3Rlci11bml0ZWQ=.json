She has sat as a Member of Parliament since 1997, and, more recently, has become one of the longest serving Home Secretaries in the United Kingdom’s history.</p>\n<p>“Canada and the United Kingdom are not only important strategic partners and allies, we share a deep friendship – a rich and diverse relationship built and maintained through our strong people-to-people ties and our shared history. We look forward to working closely with Prime Minister May as we continue to address issues of mutual interest that will ensure ongoing stability and prosperity for all of our people.</p>\n<p>“I would also like to thank David Cameron for his service and dedication to the people of the United Kingdom, especially during times of economic uncertainty. I wish him the best of luck in all his future endeavours.”</p></div>\n      "
