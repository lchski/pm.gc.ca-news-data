It is an opportunity to celebrate peace, renew friendships, and look forward to new beginnings with optimism and joy. It is also a time to reflect on the traditional notions of good and evil, and the ultimate triumph of light over darkness. Holi is celebrated by Hindus and non-Hindus alike across Canada, South Asia, and around the world.</p><p>“To mark this happy occasion, family and loved ones gather to sing, dance, eat delicacies, light bonfires, and paint each other with brightly coloured powders and dyes.</p><p>“This year, as we celebrate the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Confederation, let us take the opportunity to honour the many cultures, traditions, and beliefs that make Canada such a wonderful place to live. Canadians of the Hindu faith have made enormous contributions to Canada and have helped make it the strong and diverse country it is today.</p><p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish all those celebrating Holi a fun, joyous, and colourful festival.</p><p><i>“Holi Hai!”</i></p></div>\n      "
