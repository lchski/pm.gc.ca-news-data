The two leaders reached an agreement in principle for the financial restructuring of the Lower Churchill Projects, which will contribute to a long-term, sustainable financial base for the Projects and reduce the province’s cost of financing. They also highlighted the early learning and child care agreement that was announced yesterday. By supporting regulated child care spaces with an average fee of $10 a day in the province in 2023, this agreement will make life more affordable for families, help parents – especially women – advance their careers while raising a family, and give every child a fair chance at success. The Prime Minister reiterated that the federal government would continue to be there to offer support to Newfoundlanders and Labradorians.</p>\n\n<p>The Prime Minister expressed his thanks to the health care workers from Newfoundland and Labrador who volunteered to support the fight against COVID-19 in critical health care settings in Ontario earlier this year. The two leaders also discussed the status of COVID-19 vaccinations in the province and across the country, and collaboration on recovery and growth. The Prime Minister recognized the province’s commitments towards fighting climate change, particularly the commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>\n\n<p>Prime Minister Trudeau and Premier Furey agreed to stay in close contact to advance further shared priorities in the months ahead.</p>\n\n<h2>Associated links</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2021/07/28/securing-strong-future-newfoundland-and-labrador\">Securing a strong future for Newfoundland and Labrador</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2021/07/28/10-day-child-care-families-newfoundland-and-labrador\">$10 a day child care for families in Newfoundland and Labrador</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2021/04/18/additional-support-ontario-fight-covid-19-outbreak\">Additional support for Ontario to fight the COVID-19 outbreak</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/covid-19-vaccine-treatment/vaccine-rollout.html\">Vaccines for COVID-19: Shipments and deliveries</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2021/04/22/prime-minister-trudeau-announces-increased-climate-ambition\">Prime Minister Trudeau announces increased climate ambition</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n      "
