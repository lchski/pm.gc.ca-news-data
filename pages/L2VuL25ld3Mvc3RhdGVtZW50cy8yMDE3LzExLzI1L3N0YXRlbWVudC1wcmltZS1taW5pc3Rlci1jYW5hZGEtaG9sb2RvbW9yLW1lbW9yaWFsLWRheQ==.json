This systemic and horrific genocide, undertaken by a totalitarian Soviet regime, killed millions of Ukrainian men, women, and children by starvation. It was a failed attempt to destroy the identity and will of the Ukrainian people.</p><p>“We stand with the victims of the Holodomor and their descendants to remember and condemn this unconscionable act. Remembering history is our best hope against repeating it.</p><p>“To honour the millions of people who suffered under communist regimes, the Government of Canada – in partnership with <a href=\"http://tributetoliberty.ca/\">Tribute to Liberty</a> – is building a <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/art-monuments/upcoming-projects.html\">Memorial to the Victims of Communism</a>. This memorial recognizes Canada as a place of refuge and highlights our history of welcoming people fleeing injustice and persecution.</p><p>“On this sombre anniversary, I invite all Canadians to take time today to remember the victims of the Holodomor, and to reflect on the remarkable contributions citizens of Ukrainian descent have made to our country.</p><p>“Today, we also reaffirm Canada’s unwavering support for the people of Ukraine, its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and reforms being undertaken by Ukraine’s government to bring greater security and prosperity to its people.”</p></div>\n      "
