On this day, Coptic Christians gather to pray, exchange gifts, and visit with family and friends.</p>\n<p>“Most importantly, the New Year is a time to honour all those who sacrificed so much—including their lives—for their faith during years of intense persecution in Egypt while under Roman rule. Their courage, steadfastness, and unwavering dedication to their faith in the face of oppression continue to serve as an example to Coptic Christians today.</p>\n<p>“Today, we extend our heartfelt thanks for the many contributions Coptic Christian communities have made to Canada. We wish all those celebrating a joyful Feast, and a peaceful and healthy start to the New Year.</p>\n<p>“Happy Nayrouz!”</p></div>\n      "
