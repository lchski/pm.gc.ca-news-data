Through increased trade and investment, we are working to create more jobs and economic opportunities for our people.</p>\n\n<p>“Canada and African countries are natural partners in our shared commitment to democracy, climate change, gender equality, and economic growth that benefits everyone. The Government of Canada will continue to promote these shared values and priorities as we work together as partners to build a more peaceful world, advance human rights, and create new opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>“While the COVID-19 pandemic poses new challenges, international cooperation is more important than ever as we work together to protect the health, social, and economic well-being of all citizens, especially the most vulnerable.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, I wish everyone celebrating a happy Africa Day.
