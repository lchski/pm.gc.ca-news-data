Today, more than 165,000 Canadians of Haitian origin call Canada home, making our neighbourhoods more vibrant and our communities more prosperous.</p>\n\n<p>“On the world stage, our two countries work together toward shared goals, including through the United Nations, the Organization of American States, and the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. Canada has a longstanding commitment to Haiti, and we will continue to provide support so that all Haitians have the opportunities they need to thrive.</p>\n\n<p>“Today, I invite all Canadians to celebrate the important contributions the Haitian-Canadian community makes to our country. On behalf of the Government of Canada, I extend my best wishes to everyone celebrating the 216th anniversary of Haiti’s independence.”</p></div>\n      "
