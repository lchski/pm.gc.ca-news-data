This is a time of spiritual contemplation, fasting, prayer, and charitable giving for Muslims, who will gather with family and friends in the evening to break their day-long fast with iftar. The meal follows the sunset prayer and offers an opportunity to reflect on the values of compassion, gratitude, and generosity at the heart of Ramadan.</p>\n\n<p>“As we mark the start of Ramadan, I join all Canadians in celebrating the ongoing contributions of Muslim communities to our vibrant and diverse national fabric.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish all those celebrating a blessed and peaceful Ramadan.</p>\n\n<p>“رمضان مبارك</p>\n\n<p>“Ramadan Mubarak.”</p></div>\n      "
