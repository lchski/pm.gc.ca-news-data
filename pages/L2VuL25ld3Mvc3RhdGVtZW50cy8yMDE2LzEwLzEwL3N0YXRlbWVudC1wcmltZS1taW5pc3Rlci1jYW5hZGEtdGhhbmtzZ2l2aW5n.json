It is also a time to reach out to those less fortunate – here in Canada and around the world – and lend a helping hand.</p>\n<p>“Over the past year, Canadians have welcomed more than 30,000 Syrian refugees who fled their homes to seek a safer and better future. As these and other newcomers celebrate their first Thanksgiving in Canada, let us never forget that helping those in need is at the heart of what makes us Canadian.</p>\n<p>“Today, we also give thanks for our men and women in uniform. For some, their service and sacrifice means spending the holiday away from home.</p>\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I wish everyone a very happy Thanksgiving filled with good food and great company.”</p></div>\n      "
