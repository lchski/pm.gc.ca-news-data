We continue to work together to advance shared priorities, including governance and democracy, regional security, poverty reduction, polio eradication, trade, defence, and the fight against climate change.</p><p>“The people-to-people connections between Canada and Pakistan are older still. People from what is now Pakistan first migrated to Canada well over a century ago and, since then, our connections have continued to grow.</p><p>“As we mark the 150th anniversary of Confederation in 2017, we honour the many cultures and communities that make Canada such a wonderful place to live. Pakistani-Canadians continue to make major contributions to our country, and help make Canada the prosperous, vibrant, and open place it is today.</p><p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I offer our best wishes to all those celebrating Pakistan’s Independence Day.”</p></div>\n      "
