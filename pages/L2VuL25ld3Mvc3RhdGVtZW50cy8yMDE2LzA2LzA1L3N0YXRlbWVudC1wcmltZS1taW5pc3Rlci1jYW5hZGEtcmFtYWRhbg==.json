It is a time of community, when Muslims invite neighbours and friends to share their evening meal – iftar – recite prayers together, and encourage each other to give to charity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Ramadan reminds all of us to show appreciation for the countless blessings we enjoy and to put the needs of others before our own.</p>\n<p>“Let us take the time to recognize, and show gratitude for, the invaluable contributions of our Muslim communities that enrich our national fabric each and every day. Canada’s cultural diversity is one of our greatest strengths and sources of pride.</p>\n<p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish all those observing this holy month a blessed and peaceful Ramadan.</p>\n<p>“Ramadan Mubarak!”</p></div>\n      "
