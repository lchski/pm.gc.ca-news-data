It has been worn by our astronauts in space, by the brave women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces, and thousands of backpackers around the globe. Our flag has been planted on Mount Everest, raised over Olympic podiums, and proudly flown at our embassies.</p>\n<p>“No matter where the Maple Leaf flies, our flag represents the values that our country holds most dear: peace, freedom, respect, compassion, and diversity. As Canada moves towards a greater leadership role in the world, I am confident that our flag will remain synonymous with these cherished Canadian values.</p>\n<p>“On this important day, I invite all Canadians to take part in Canadian Heritage’s <em>‘<a href=\"http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1448567781606\">Share your Moment with the Flag</a>’ </em>Challenge, to celebrate our national flag and what it stands for.”</p></div>\n      "
