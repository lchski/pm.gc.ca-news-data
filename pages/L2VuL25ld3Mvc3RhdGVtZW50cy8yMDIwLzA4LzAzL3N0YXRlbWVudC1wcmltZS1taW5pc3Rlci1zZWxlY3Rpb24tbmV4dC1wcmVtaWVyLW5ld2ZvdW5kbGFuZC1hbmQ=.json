This includes investing in health care, continuing to support joint infrastructure projects, and creating good middle class jobs in the province through partnerships like the <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/atlantic-canada-opportunities/atlanticgrowth.html\">Atlantic Growth Strategy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>“I thank Dwight Ball for his service to Newfoundland and Labrador and Canada, and his hard work over the past months as part of Team Canada to combat the impacts of COVID-19 and keep Canadians safe and healthy. Over the past few years, we have also worked closely together to renew the Atlantic Accord, fight climate change, protect our environment, and build an economy that works for everyone. I wish Dwight and his family the very best in the future.”</p></div>\n      "
