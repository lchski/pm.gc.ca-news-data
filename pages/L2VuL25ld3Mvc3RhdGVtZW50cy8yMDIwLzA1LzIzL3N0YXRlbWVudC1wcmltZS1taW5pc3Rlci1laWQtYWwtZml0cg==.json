To celebrate the occasion, Muslims will usually attend special morning prayers, share meals with loved ones, and give generously to others.</p>\n\n<p>“This year, many Eid traditions and celebrations are different as we continue to fight COVID-19. Just as they did throughout Ramadan, Muslim Canadians will pray at home and turn to virtual ways to mark this special day. By following the advice of public health experts, we will get through these challenging times together.</p>\n\n<p>“Throughout Ramadan, Muslim&nbsp;Canadians have been helping those in need with donations of food and supplies, and many of those fasting have been fighting back against the pandemic as medical and essential workers.</p>\n\n<p>“For all of us, Eid al-Fitr is an opportunity to recognize how Muslim Canadians continue to shape our country for the better, and to celebrate the diversity that makes us who we are.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish all those celebrating a joyful Eid.</p>\n\n<p>“Eid Mubarak.”</p></div>\n      "
