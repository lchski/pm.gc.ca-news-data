The selection process will reflect the fundamental role that more than 1500 Canadians play in our democracy as they serve on commissions, boards, Crown corporations, agencies, and tribunals across the country.</p>\n<p>The Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, today announced the new approach – one where an open, transparent, and merit-based selection process will support Ministers in making appointment recommendations for positions within their portfolio. The new strategy will result in the recommendation of high-quality candidates who truly reflect Canada’s diversity.</p>\n<p>The new approach will apply to the majority of non-judicial appointments, and will make hundreds of part-time positions subject to a formal selection process for the first time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Until the new approach has been implemented, appointments or re-appointments will only be made to positions essential to government business or to those that deliver important services to Canadians. These appointments and re-appointments will be for up to one year in length, subject to legislative provisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Quote</strong></p>\n<p>“We are committed to raising the bar on openness and transparency in government to make sure that it remains focused on serving Canadians as effectively and efficiently as possible. Government must serve the public interest, and remain accountable to Canadians.”</p>\n<p>- <em>Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada </em></p>\n<p><strong>Associated Link</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.appointments-nominations.gc.ca/index.asp?lang=eng\">Governor in Council Appointments</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n      "
