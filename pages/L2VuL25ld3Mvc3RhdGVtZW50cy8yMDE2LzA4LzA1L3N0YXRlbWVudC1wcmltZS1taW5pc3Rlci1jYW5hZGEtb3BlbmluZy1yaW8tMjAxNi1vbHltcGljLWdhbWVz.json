These athletes, along with their coaches, families, and friends, have sacrificed so much to reach this level, and to embody the Olympic motto – Citius – Altius – Fortius (Faster, Higher, Stronger).</p>\n<p>“On behalf of all Canadians, I extend my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to our athletes who have displayed such tremendous dedication and commitment. They motivate us—especially our young people—to be more active in&nbsp;sport, whether it is in our own backyards, in local parks, or in&nbsp;sport&nbsp;venues from coast to coast to coast. We are very proud of each and every one of them, and confident that they will be excellent ambassadors of Canada’s culture, athleticism, and values.</p>\n<p>“We,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1459974727876\">Team Canada</a>—35 million people strong—will be watching and cheering on 314 Canadian athletes at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. Good luck and make us proud!”</p></div>\n      "
