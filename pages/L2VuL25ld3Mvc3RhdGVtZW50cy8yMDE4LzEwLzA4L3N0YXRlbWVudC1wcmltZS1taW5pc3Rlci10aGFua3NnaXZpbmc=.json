It’s a chance to appreciate our communities, and find new ways to give back. As we recognize the people who make a difference in our lives, we take time to reflect on how we can show more compassion to those most in need.</p><p>“Today, we also honour members of the Canadian Armed Forces, past and present. Each day, they make sacrifices to help build a safer, more peaceful world for everyone.</p><p>“This holiday, I encourage all Canadians to celebrate our connections and seek new ways to strengthen them. Canada is strong because of the care and stewardship that people bring to communities across our country. Let’s celebrate our neighbours near and far, and do our part to make Canada an even better place to call home.</p><p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving filled with good company, joy, and peace.”</p></div>\n      "
