These men and women were selected using the Government’s new merit-based system, a real example of democracy in action that will contribute to a more modern and independent Upper Chamber. I look forward to working with those summoned to the Senate and seeing them use their remarkable knowledge and experience to benefit our great country.”<br>– <cite>Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada</cite></p></blockquote><h2>Quick Facts</h2><ul><li>Under the Canadian Constitution, the Governor General appoints people to the Senate. By convention, Senators are appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister.</li><li>For the first time ever, the process was opened up to allow Canadians to apply. Following a four-week application period, which generated over 2,700 applications from Canadians across the country, the candidate submissions were reviewed by the Independent Advisory Board for Senate Appointments, which then provided the Prime Minister with non-binding recommendations. From that pool of candidates, the Prime Minister selected the six people he will recommend to the Governor General for appointment to the Senate.</li><li>In making their recommendations, the Independent Advisory Board for Senate Appointments was guided by public, transparent, non-partisan and merit-based criteria to identify highly-qualified people.</li><li>Once appointed by the Governor General and summoned to the Senate, the new Senators will join their peers in examining and revising legislation, investigating national issues, and representing regional, provincial and minority interests – all important functions in a modern democracy.</li></ul><h2>Related Product</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/en/news/backgrounders/2016/10/31/biographical-notes\">Biographical Notes</a></li></ul><h2>Associated Links</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.democraticinstitutions.gc.ca/eng/content/frequently-asked-questions-senate-appointments-process-0\">Frequently Asked Questions – Senate Appointments Process</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/campaign/independent-advisory-board-for-senate-appointments.html\">Independent Advisory Board for Senate Appointments</a></li><li><a href=\"/en/news/news-releases/2016/10/27/prime-minister-announces-intention-recommend-appointment-nine-new\">Prime Minister announces intention to recommend the appointment of nine new Senators</a></li><li><a href=\"/en/news/news-releases/2016/03/18/prime-minister-announces-intention-recommend-appointment-seven-new\">Prime Minister announces intention to recommend the appointment of seven new Senators</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.democraticinstitutions.gc.ca/eng/content/minister-democratic-institutions-announces-launch-permanent-phase-independent-senate\">Minister of Democratic Institutions Announces Launch of the Permanent Phase of the Independent Senate Appointments Process</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.democraticinstitutions.gc.ca/eng/content/minister-democratic-institutions-announces-establishment-independent-advisory-board-senate\">Minister of Democratic Institutions Announces Establishment of the Independent Advisory Board for Senate Appointments</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.democraticinstitutions.gc.ca/eng/content/government-announces-immediate-senate-reform\">Government Announces Immediate Senate Reform</a></li></ul></div>\n      "
