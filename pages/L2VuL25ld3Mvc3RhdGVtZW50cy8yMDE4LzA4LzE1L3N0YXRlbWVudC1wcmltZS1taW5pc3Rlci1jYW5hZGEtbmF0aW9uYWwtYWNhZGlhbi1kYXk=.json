Among the first French settlers in North America, the Acadians were the victims of persecution for centuries. But in the face of deportation, exile, and oppression, they showed resilience, courage, and determination. Against great odds, Acadians worked together to defend their culture, promote their language, and build prosperous communities.</p><p>“Today, Acadians remain proud of their heritage and deeply rooted in their culture. Many continue to live off the land and the waters around them, while others continue to succeed across various industries, on both the national and international stage.</p><p>“Forward-looking and strong in their heritage, Acadians continue to make our country a better place to live. Today, we honour this proud people and celebrate their important contributions to Canada.</p><p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I wish all Acadians – from coast to coast to coast and around the world – a happy National Acadian Day.”</p></div>\n      "
