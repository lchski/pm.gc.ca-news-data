The vibrant Ukrainian-Canadian community—nearly 1.3 million people strong—has contributed immeasurably to building Canada, and has helped forge a strong, enduring relationship between both of our countries.</p>\n\n<p>“During my recent official visit to the country, I was reminded of our deep historical ties and our shared desire for a prosperous future for Ukrainians and Canadians. I was moved by the sacrifices that Ukrainians have made, and continue to make, for their freedom, democracy, and independence.</p>\n\n<p>“As we mark this momentous occasion, we reiterate our strong support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Canada fully supports Ukraine as it takes important steps to bring greater security, prosperity, and economic independence to its people.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating a happy Ukrainian Independence Day.</p>\n\n<p>“Slava Ukraini!”</p></div>\n      "
