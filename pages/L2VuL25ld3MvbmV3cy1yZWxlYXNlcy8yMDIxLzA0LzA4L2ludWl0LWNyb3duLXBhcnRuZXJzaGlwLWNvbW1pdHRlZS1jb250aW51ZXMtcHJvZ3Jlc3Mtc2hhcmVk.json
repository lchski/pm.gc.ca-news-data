This and other areas of shared progress, such as the ongoing co-development of an Inuit Nunangat Policy, represent key steps toward reconciliation, Inuit self-determination, and supporting meaningful, </span><span>community-driven solutions to the distinct issues faced by Inuit.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span>The Committee also discussed ongoing work in several areas, including improving food security, meeting infrastructure needs across Inuit Nunangat, implementing <em>An Act respecting First Nations, Inuit, and Métis children, youth and families</em>, co-developing distinctions-based Indigenous health legislation, addressing violence against Inuit women, girls, and LGBTQ2 people, and supporting the revitalization, maintenance, protection, and promotion of Inuktut.</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span>In addition, the Committee established its 2021 work plan on reconciliation measures, outlined ways to create more opportunities for Inuit as we recover from the pandemic, and continued targeted discussions on overcoming barriers to create distinction-based funding for infrastructure projects in </span><span lang=\"EN-CA\" xml:lang=\"EN-CA\">Inuit Nunangat</span><span>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span lang=\"EN-CA\" xml:lang=\"EN-CA\">The Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee reflects a shared commitment to a renewed Inuit-Crown relationship and reconciliation based on </span><span><span>affirmation of rights, respect, cooperation, and partnership.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<h2><span><span><span><span lang=\"EN-CA\" xml:lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>Quotes</span></span></span></span></span></h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><span><span><span><span lang=\"EN-CA\" xml:lang=\"EN-CA\"><span>“The global COVID-19 pandemic has </span></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\" xml:lang=\"EN-CA\">disproportionately affected the health and wellbeing of people across Inuit Nunangat.
