It led to a conflict that lasted 26 years, killing tens of thousands more people and leaving lasting wounds in communities across Sri Lanka.</p>\n\n<p>“Thanks in large part to the advocacy of Tamil-Canadians, Canada implemented a Special Measures program in 1983 to welcome more than 1,800 Tamils. We see the resiliency of Tamil-Canadians in the tremendous contributions they make to Canada every day.</p>\n\n<p>“I extend my deepest sympathies to all those who suffered and lost family, friends, and neighbours during Black July and the conflict that followed. Canada continues to offer its full support to those working toward meaningful justice, accountability, peace, and reconciliation in the country.”</p></div>\n      "
