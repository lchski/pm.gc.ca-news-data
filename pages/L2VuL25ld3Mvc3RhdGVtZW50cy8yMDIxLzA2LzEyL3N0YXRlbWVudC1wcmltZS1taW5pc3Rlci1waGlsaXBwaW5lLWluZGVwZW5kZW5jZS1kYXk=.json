We also collaborate through various multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. Nearly one million people of Filipino descent live in Canada and make our country a better place every day.</p>\n\n<p>“Across the country, many members of the Filipino community have taken on essential roles in the fight against the global COVID‑19 pandemic. Some have been on the front lines, keeping Canadians safe and healthy, and caring for our most vulnerable. I thank them for their courage and sacrifices during these difficult times. You have shown us the best of what it means to serve your community.</p>\n\n<p>“Today, and throughout June, as we mark Filipino Heritage Month, I invite all Canadians to recognize the significant contributions Filipino communities make to our country. On behalf of the Government of Canada, I wish all those celebrating today a happy Independence Day.</p>\n\n<p>“Maligayang Araw ng Kalayaan!”</p></div>\n      "
