During the cold winter days ahead, let us find time to reach out to family, friends, and our communities to celebrate all of the blessings we enjoy.</p>\n<p>“The lights illuminated in our nation’s capital – and in provincial and territorial capitals across the country – link us together and serve as a powerful symbol of our Canadian values of peace, unity, and hope for the future.</p>\n<p>“We look forward to the upcoming holiday season and to all of the heart-warming traditions we will soon share together. We also send our warmest wishes to those friends and family members, including those serving with our Canadian Armed Forces, who are unable to be with us. While far away, you are with us in our thoughts.”</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit: <a href=\"http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1445434705202\">Christmas Lights Across Canada</a></p></div>\n      "
