It has travelled to the highest peaks on Mount Everest, into space with the first Canadian astronaut, and around the world on the arms of Canadian Armed Forces members. This summer, Canadian athletes will wear it with pride at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>\n\n<p>“Today, I invite Canadians from coast to coast to coast to reflect on our flag and what it means to each of us – a symbol of our rich history, and a promise of the bright future we are building together.”</p></div>\n      "
