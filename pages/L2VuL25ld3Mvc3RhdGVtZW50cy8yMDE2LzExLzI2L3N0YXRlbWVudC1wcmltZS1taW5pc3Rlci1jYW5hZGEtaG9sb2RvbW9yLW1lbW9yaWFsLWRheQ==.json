This genocidal act was designed to destroy the identity and will of the Ukrainian people. It did not achieve its aim. Despite the brutality of the Holodomor, Ukrainians endured and, after decades of Soviet control, Ukraine achieved its independence in 1991.</p>\n<p>“Canada stands firm with the Ukrainian people in condemning the atrocities of the Holodomor, and ensuring that its victims are not forgotten. We also remain committed to supporting Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as the important steps taken by the Ukrainian government to bring greater security, prosperity, and economic independence to their people.</p>\n<p>“I invite all Canadians to take time today to remember those who suffered as a result of the Holodomor and to reflect on the important contributions citizens of Ukrainian descent have made all across Canada. Their resilience and determination have helped build Canada’s diverse society, which is our strength and pride.”</p></div>\n      "
