The Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, announced that Canada will join the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany as one of Four Framework Nations that will lead multinational NATO battlegroups in Eastern Europe.</p>\n<p>The NATO leaders also agreed to bolster support for Iraq through defence capacity building, and will provide air surveillance capabilities to the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL.
