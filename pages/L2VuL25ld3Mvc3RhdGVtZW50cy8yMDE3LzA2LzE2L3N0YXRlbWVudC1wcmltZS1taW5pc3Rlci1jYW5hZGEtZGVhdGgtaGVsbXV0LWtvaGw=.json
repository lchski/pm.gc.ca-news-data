Within a year of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, this dream was realized with the reunification of East and West Germany and the first free, universal election in the country in almost 60 years.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">“His calls for unity did not stop at the German border. Mr. Kohl also advocated for a political and economic union within Europe. He spearheaded the Maastricht Treaty, which led to the current European Union and the single European currency. </span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">“I have fond memories of meeting Mr. Kohl when I was a child. Many Germans will be mourning his passage today. I mourn alongside them.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">“On behalf of all Canadians, Sophie and I offer our condolences to the family and friends of Mr. Kohl, the German people, and all who admired his tireless efforts in favour of unity and cooperation.”&nbsp;</span></p></div>\n      "
