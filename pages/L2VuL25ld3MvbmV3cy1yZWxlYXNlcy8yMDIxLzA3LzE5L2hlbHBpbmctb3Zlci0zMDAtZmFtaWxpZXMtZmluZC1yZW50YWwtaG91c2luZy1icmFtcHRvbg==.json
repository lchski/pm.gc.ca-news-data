The government is committed to eliminating chronic homelessness in Canada and will continue working to grow the middle class, build back strong communities, and make life more affordable for Canadians.</p>\n\n<h2>Quotes</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We know that finding an affordable place to live is a challenge for many Canadians in communities across the country.
