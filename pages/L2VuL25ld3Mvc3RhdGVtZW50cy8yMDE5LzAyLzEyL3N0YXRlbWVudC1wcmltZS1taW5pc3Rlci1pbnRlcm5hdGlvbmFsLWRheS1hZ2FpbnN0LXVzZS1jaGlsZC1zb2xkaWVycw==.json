They are denied their childhood and, all too often, a chance to reclaim their future and lead a normal life.</p><p>“The use of child soldiers has no place in our world. On the International Day Against the Use of Child Soldiers, also known as <a href=\"https://www.child-soldiers.org/news/red-hand-day-2019\">Red Hand Day</a>, Canada reaffirms its long-standing <a href=\"https://international.gc.ca/world-monde/issues_development-enjeux_developpement/human_rights-droits_homme/armed_conflict-conflits_armes.aspx?lang=eng\">commitment</a> to protect children and end this heinous practice.</p><p>“Earlier this month, Canada hosted international partners to develop new guidance to implement the <a href=\"/en/news/backgrounders/2017/11/15/vancouver-principles-peacekeeping-and-prevention-recruitment-and-use\">Vancouver Principles</a>, which have now been endorsed by 71 nations around the world. Canada also provided funding for a project with the <a href=\"https://www.childsoldiers.org/\">Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative</a> and Dalhousie University to help end recruitment of child soldiers in South Sudan.

As part of our G7 Presidency last year, Canada and international partners <a href=\"/en/news/news-releases/2018/06/09/canada-and-partners-announce-historic-investment-education-women-and\">announced a historic investment of $3.8 billion</a> – the single largest investment of its kind – to support education for women and girls in crisis and conflict situations. Canada has also endorsed the <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2017/02/canada_endorses_safeschoolsdeclaration.html\">Safe Schools Declaration</a> to protect schools, teachers, and students during armed conflict.</p><p>“Canada will continue to lead the fight against the recruitment and use of child soldiers. By bringing countries together, and putting the Vancouver Principles into action, we can make sure children remain children, and build a safer, more just future for all.”</p></div>\n      "
