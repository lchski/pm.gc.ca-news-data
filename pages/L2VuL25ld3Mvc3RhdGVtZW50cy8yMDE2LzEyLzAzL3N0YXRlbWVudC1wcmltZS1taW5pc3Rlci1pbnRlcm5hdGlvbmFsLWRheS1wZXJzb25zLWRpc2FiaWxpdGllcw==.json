Over the last several months, Minister Carla Qualtrough – Canada’s first ever federal minister of persons with disabilities – has consulted across the country on planned accessibility legislation to promote equality of opportunity and increase the inclusion and participation of Canadians who have disabilities or functional limitations. I welcome everyone to partake in these consultations, which will continue until the end of February 2017.</p>\n<p>“Today, and every day, let us take action to break down the barriers that exclude Canadians with disabilities. We cannot rest until persons with disabilities have the same opportunities as everyone else.”</p></div>\n      "
