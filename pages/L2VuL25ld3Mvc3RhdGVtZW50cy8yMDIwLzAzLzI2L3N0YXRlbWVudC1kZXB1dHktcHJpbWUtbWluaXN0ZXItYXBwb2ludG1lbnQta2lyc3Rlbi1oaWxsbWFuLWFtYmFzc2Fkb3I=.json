Her work on trade, on the new NAFTA, as Acting Ambassador, and most recently on our cross-border response to COVID-&nbsp;19, makes her the obvious, outstanding candidate for this role.</p>\n\n<p>“As the Prime Minister has said, Ms. Hillman is a brilliant lawyer, skilled diplomat, and gifted team leader. I also note, with pride, that Ms. Hillman is the first woman in Canadian history to be appointed to this key diplomatic post.</p>\n\n<p>“I have had the privilege of working closely with Ms. Hillman since November 2015. She offered wise counsel in my first days at International Trade – and continues to do so to this day. She is among the most reliably kind, smart, and effective people I know – and we are fortunate to have her in this critically important job at this time.”</p></div>\n      "
