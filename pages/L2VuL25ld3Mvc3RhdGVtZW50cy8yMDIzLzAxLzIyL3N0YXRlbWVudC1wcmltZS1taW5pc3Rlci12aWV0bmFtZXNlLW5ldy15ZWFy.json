Family and friends will gather and find inspiration in the cat, which symbolizes hope and success. They will honour their ancestors, share a special meal, and exchange wishes of good luck and prosperity for the year to come.</p>\n\n<p>“The Lunar New Year is also an opportunity to celebrate the important contributions Vietnamese Canadians have made – and continue to make – across Canada that make our country stronger, more prosperous, and more resilient. With the rise of Anti-Asian racism, it’s up to every one of us to stand up against hatred and celebrate Canada’s diversity.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of all Canadians, Sophie and I wish good health, happiness, and peace in the Year of the Cat to everyone celebrating.</p>\n\n<p>“Chúc mừng năm mới.”</p></div>\n      "
