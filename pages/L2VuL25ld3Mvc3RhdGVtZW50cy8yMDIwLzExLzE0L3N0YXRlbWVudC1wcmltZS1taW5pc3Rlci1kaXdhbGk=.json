Celebrations will look different this year as we continue to fight the global COVID-19 pandemic, but at their heart is a message that has never been more important: light, good, and knowledge will always triumph over darkness, evil, and ignorance.</p>\n\n<p>“For all of us, Diwali is an opportunity to recognize the contributions that Canadians of Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist faiths make to build a better, more resilient country. I also want to take a moment to thank everyone working on the front lines in health care, our essential services, and the local organizations that have been there for us.</p>\n\n<p>“I encourage you to continue to follow your local public health guidelines so that we can keep our communities safe. And together, we will continue to build a Canada that is fairer, safer, and more inclusive for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of all Canadians, Sophie and I wish a happy Diwali to everyone celebrating.”</p></div>\n      "
