We also acknowledge the work we still need to do so that everyone can live in a world where their rights are respected and they have an equal opportunity to succeed.</p>\n\n<p>“To achieve the goal of a just and equal future, we first need to listen. When we follow the advice of leaders, role models, and community members, we can make real progress.</p>\n\n<p>“In the past weeks and in the days and weeks ahead, we all have and will continue to feel the impacts of the rapidly evolving COVID-19 global pandemic. It is more important than ever to avoid the spread of fear, misinformation, and stigma. In times of need, our strength is determined by our ability to support and care for each other, as neighbours and as a community.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, I encourage Canadians to stand up together against discrimination and racism, and to promote our values of respect for diversity, inclusion, and openness.”</p></div>\n      "
