It is a time to honour, remember, and reflect on the victims of this 26-year war.<br> &nbsp;<br> “Over the past seven years, I have met many victims of this war, and have been deeply moved by their heroic stories of trauma and loss.&nbsp;Much work lies ahead to heal the wounds of all those who have suffered, and to achieve long-term peace and reconciliation on the island.<br> &nbsp;<br> “Tamil-Canadians are an integral part of our country and have overcome much adversity. I extend my deepest sympathy and support to Canadians of Tamil descent.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> “I am encouraged that the Sri Lankan government is committed to working with the United Nations Human Rights Council and the international community towards seeking accountability in their country. A robust accountability mechanism must enlist the confidence of the victims of this war, through the meaningful engagement of foreign and Commonwealth investigators, prosecutors, and judges. Canada will continue to engage the international community in investigating and addressing serious violations of international law in Sri Lanka and around the world. We stand willing to assist the government of Sri Lanka in fulfilling this commitment.”&nbsp;</p></div>\n      "
