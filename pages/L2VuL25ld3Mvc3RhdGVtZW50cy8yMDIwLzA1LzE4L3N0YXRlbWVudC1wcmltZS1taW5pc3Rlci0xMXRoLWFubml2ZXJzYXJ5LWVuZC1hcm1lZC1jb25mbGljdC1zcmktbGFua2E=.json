This is a time to reflect on the 26 years of conflict, including the last phase of the war in Mullivaikal, and the lives that were lost, and to remember those who were injured, went missing, or were displaced from their homes and communities.</p>\n\n<p>“Over the past 11 years, I have met with many Canadians, who were personally affected by this war. Their stories of incalculable loss, tremendous adversity, and continued resilience are a solemn reminder of the need to continue working toward lasting peace and reconciliation.</p>\n\n<p>“Learning from the past is crucial to building for the future. I reiterate the call for Sri Lanka to pursue a meaningful accountability process. Canada continues to offer its support to the Sri Lankan government and all those working toward justice, reconciliation and inclusion, all of which underpin long-term peace and prosperity in the country.”</p>\n\n<p>“Canada is made stronger by its diversity, and the many cultures and heritages that that call this country home.”</p></div>\n      "
