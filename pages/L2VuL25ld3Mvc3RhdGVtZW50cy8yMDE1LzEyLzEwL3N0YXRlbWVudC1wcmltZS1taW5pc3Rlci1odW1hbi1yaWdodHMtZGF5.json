Our Freedoms.&nbsp;Always.’ – inspires us to reflect on the rights that form the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world.</p>\n<p>“Today, we pause to consider the importance of human rights. We take this occasion to celebrate our very own John Humphrey who was instrumental in drafting the original <em>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</em>, adopted by the United Nations 67 years ago today.</p>\n<p>“With the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> as a guide, the Government will continue advocating against injustice and discrimination and safeguarding human rights and freedoms both here and abroad.</p>\n<p>“We are fortunate to live in one of the most diverse countries in the world; a country that is strong not in spite of its diversity, but because of it. On this day, I encourage all Canadians to reflect on the rights and freedoms that we enjoy in our great country.&nbsp; Let us commit to upholding and promoting them every day in our homes, schools, and communities.”</p></div>\n      "
