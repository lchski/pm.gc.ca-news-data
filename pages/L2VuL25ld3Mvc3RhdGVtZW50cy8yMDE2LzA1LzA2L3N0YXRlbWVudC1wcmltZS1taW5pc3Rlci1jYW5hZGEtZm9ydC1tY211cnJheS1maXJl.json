We are thinking of – and praying for – the people of Fort McMurray. Though Alberta’s loss is profound, we will get through this tragedy together: as friends, as neighbours, as Canadians.</p><p>“I encourage everyone to make a donation to www.redcross.ca&nbsp;, and help the thousands of displaced residents of Fort McMurray.</p><p>“The Government of Canada will match every dollar donated to the Canadian Red Cross in support of the Fort McMurray relief effort. Our commitment will apply to individual charitable donations made within Canada, it will be backdated to May 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2016, and it will continue until May 31<sup>st</sup>, 2016. There will be no financial cap on the federal government's contribution.</p><p>“We applaud the Government of Alberta, who has also agreed to match donations. As a result, for every dollar donated by Canadians, the Red Cross will receive a total of $3.</p><p>“The outpouring of goodwill and compassion we have already seen from Canadians across the country has not only been inspirational, but stands as a testament to who we are as a nation.</p><p>“I would once again like to thank the many first responders who are working&nbsp;tirelessly, day and night, to fight this fire. To those who have lost so much: we are resilient, we are Canadians, and we will make it through this difficult time, together.”</p></div>\n      "
