This year, as we continue to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and follow health guidelines to keep each other and our communities safe, celebrations will look different – especially for those who were unable to participate in the pilgrimage.</p>\n\n<p>“However, the values at the heart of Eid al-Adha have never been more important. Whether it is supporting a local charity, being there for neighbours, or helping those who are more vulnerable, Muslim Canadians continue to show us what it means to serve our community.</p>\n\n<p>“Today, we recognize that service and the many contributions that Muslim Canadians have made, and continue to make, to our communities and to our country.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish all those celebrating a happy Eid al-Adha.</p>\n\n<p>“Eid Mubarak!”</p></div>\n      "
