This special year, we marked the 50th anniversary of the arrival of thousands of Ismailis in Canada after they were expelled from Uganda. Since their arrival, they have become a vibrant part of Canada’s social and economic fabric and made our country a better place to live.</p>\n\n<p>“Today, I join people around the world in wishing the Aga Khan a very happy birthday. We wish him good health and happiness on this special day and for years to come.</p>\n\n<p>“Salgirah Khushiali Mubarak!”</p></div>\n      "
