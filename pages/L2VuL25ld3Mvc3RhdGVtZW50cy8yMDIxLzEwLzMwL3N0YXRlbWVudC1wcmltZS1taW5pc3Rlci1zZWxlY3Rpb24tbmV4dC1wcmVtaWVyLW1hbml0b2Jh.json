She will be the first woman in Manitoba to hold this office.</p>\n\n<p>“I look forward to working closely with Ms. Stefanson to continue protecting and supporting Manitobans and all Canadians as we finish the fight against COVID-19. Together, we will find solutions to the challenges of today and tomorrow, build a strong economic recovery that works for everyone, and move forward on the issues that matter most to Manitobans. These include addressing infrastructure priorities, strengthening the health care system, delivering on $10-a-day child care, accelerating climate action, and advancing reconciliation with Indigenous peoples.</p>\n\n<p>“I thank Brian Pallister for his contributions to Manitoba and Canada during his nearly three decades of service, including as premier and as a former Member of Parliament. His leadership during the past year and a half helped keep Manitobans healthy and supported through the pandemic. I also thank Interim Leader and Premier Kelvin Goertzen for answering the call to provide stability over this transitional period. I wish them both all the best in their future endeavours.”</p></div>\n      "
