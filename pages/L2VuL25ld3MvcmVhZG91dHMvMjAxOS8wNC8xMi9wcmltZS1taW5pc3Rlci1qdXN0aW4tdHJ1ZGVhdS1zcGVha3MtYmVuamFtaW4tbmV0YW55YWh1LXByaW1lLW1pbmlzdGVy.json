Prime Minister Trudeau said he looked forward to working closely with the new Israeli government, and underlined the two countries’ long history as close friends and steadfast allies.</p>\n\n<p>During the conversation, the two leaders spoke of the underlying democratic values shared by both countries.&nbsp;The Prime Minister expressed Canada’s continued and strong support for Middle East peace efforts leading to a two-state solution while standing firmly with Israel in its right to live in peace and security with its neighbours. Canada and Israel cooperate closely on matters of regional security. The leaders discussed the operation to rescue the White Helmets and their families from Syria in July 2018, which would not have been possible without close cooperation between Canada and Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Prime Minister Trudeau and Prime Minister Netanyahu discussed the benefits of trade between Canada and Israel, and how the updated Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement will create jobs and economic growth in both countries. The new trade agreement will also increase the already strong and vibrant people-to-people ties between Canadians and Israelis in this 70th year of Canada-Israel diplomatic relations.</p></div>\n      "
