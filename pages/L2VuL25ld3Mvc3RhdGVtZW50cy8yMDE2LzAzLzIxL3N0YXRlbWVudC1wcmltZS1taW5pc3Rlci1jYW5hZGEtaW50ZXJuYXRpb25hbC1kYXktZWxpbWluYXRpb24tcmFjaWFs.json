But the history of Canada is one in which we constantly challenge ourselves, and each other, one in which we fight racism and discrimination in order to protect equality and justice.</p>\n<p>“We still have a lot of work to do. Far too many people around the world continue to be denied their most basic human rights simply because of the colour of their skin, their faith, or their ethnic background.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“On this day, I urge all Canadians to stand against racism and all forms of discrimination whenever and wherever they occur. Diversity is at the very heart of Canada. It is who we are and what we believe in.”</p></div>\n      "
