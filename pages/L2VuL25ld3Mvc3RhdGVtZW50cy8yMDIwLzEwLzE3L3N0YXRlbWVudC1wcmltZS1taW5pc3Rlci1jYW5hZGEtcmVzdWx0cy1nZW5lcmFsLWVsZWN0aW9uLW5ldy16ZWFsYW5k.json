Her dedication and determination have&nbsp;helped advance these important issues, and I look forward to continuing our progress to build a more inclusive, equal, and resilient world for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>“Canada and New Zealand share a strong friendship built on close people-to-people ties and common priorities. Our two countries will continue to work together to defend our shared values and international institutions, as we build a prosperous future for all our citizens through agreements like the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the recently concluded Global Trade and Gender Arrangement. I look forward to working with Prime Minister Ardern on advancing these priorities when New Zealand hosts the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum next year.</p>\n\n<p>“We remain committed to deepening our relationship and working towards a more just, sustainable, and peaceful world.”</p></div>\n      "
