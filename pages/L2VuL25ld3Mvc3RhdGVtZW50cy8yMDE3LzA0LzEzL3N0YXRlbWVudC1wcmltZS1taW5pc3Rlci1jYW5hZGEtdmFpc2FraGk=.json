Family and friends will gather to pray at Gurdwaras and to participate in Khalsa Day parades.</p><p>“Next week, we will mark the 35<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>anniversary of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Just as the creation of the Khalsa defines Sikhism, the Charter defines our country. It defends our individual rights and freedoms and, for Canadians of Sikh faith, ensures the Five Ks are protected.</p><p>“This year, as we mark the 150<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>anniversary of Confederation, let us take the opportunity to honour the many cultures, traditions, and beliefs that make Canada such a wonderful place to live. Canada is proud to be home to one of the largest Sikh populations in the world. Sikh Canadians help make Canada the strong and diverse country it is today.</p><p>“On behalf of all Canadians, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating a joyful Vaisakhi.</p><p>“Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh.”</p></div>\n      "
