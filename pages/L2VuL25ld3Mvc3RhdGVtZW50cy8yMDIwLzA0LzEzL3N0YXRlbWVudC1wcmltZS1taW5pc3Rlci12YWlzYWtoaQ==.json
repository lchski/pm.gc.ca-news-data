This year, as we continue to feel the impacts of the COVID-19 global pandemic, the Sikh community is celebrating differently, following the recommendations of our public health experts. Please continue to stay at home. And if you have to go out, remember to keep a safe distance of at least two metres from others to keep yourselves and your loved ones safe.</p>\n\n<p>“Canada is home to one of the largest Sikh populations in the world. For all Canadians, Vaisakhi is a time to celebrate the important contributions that Canadians of Sikh faith make to our country, and to learn about Sikhism’s rich traditions and teachings of equality, unity, selfless service, and social justice.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating a joyful Vaisakhi.</p>\n\n<p>“Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh.”</p></div>\n      "
