Honourable Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada</em></p>\n<p><strong>Quick Facts</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The North America region has a combined population of almost 530 million and an economy that represents more than one-quarter of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP).</li>\n<li>The three countries are among each other’s largest trading partners and sources of foreign investment. In 2015, North American trilateral merchandise trade amounted to US$1 trillion, and our combined GDP has more than doubled over the past two decades, rising from US$8 trillion (in 1993) to $US20.6 trillion today.</li>\n<li>The three leaders will pledge to increase trilateral defence cooperation, expand their roles in UN peace operations, collaborate more on global public health needs, and work together to address climate change. To encourage clean growth, they will commit to drive down short-lived climate pollutants, and advance clean and secure energy – with the goal of 50% clean power generation across the continent by 2025.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Associated Links</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/campaign-campagne/nals-slna/nals-2016-slna.aspx?lang=eng\">North American Leaders’ Summit 2016</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/en/news/statements/2016/06/29/leaders’-statement-north-american-climate-clean-energy-and-environment\">Leaders’ Statement on a North American Climate, Clean Energy, and Environment Partnership</a></li>\n<li>Fact Sheet - <a href=\"/en/news/backgrounders/2016/06/29/border-facilitation\">Border Facilitation</a></li>\n<li>Fact Sheet - <a href=\"/en/news/backgrounders/2016/06/29/economic-prosperity-–-trade-and-competitiveness\">Economic Prosperity: Trade and Competitiveness</a></li>\n<li>Fact Sheet - <a href=\"/en/news/backgrounders/2016/06/29/regional-and-global-issues\">Regional and Global Issues</a></li>\n<li>Fact Sheet - <a href=\"/en/news/backgrounders/2016/06/29/security-and-defence\">Security and Defence</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n      "
