We look forward to hosting them all on a future visit to Canada.</p>\n\n<p>“To celebrate the birth, Canada will donate $100,000 to the <a href=\"http://www.breakfastclubcanada.org/\">Breakfast Club of Canada</a>, an organization that works to nurture children’s potential by providing healthy breakfasts before school. Every day, the Club helps feed more than 220,000&nbsp;students in over 1,600 schools across the country, to make sure young Canadians get the healthy start they need to thrive. The donation announced today will help bring the Breakfast Club to five new schools, reaching over 500 more children daily. This represents more than 100,000 breakfasts over a school year.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I extend our warmest congratulations to Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Royal Family.”</p></div>\n      "
