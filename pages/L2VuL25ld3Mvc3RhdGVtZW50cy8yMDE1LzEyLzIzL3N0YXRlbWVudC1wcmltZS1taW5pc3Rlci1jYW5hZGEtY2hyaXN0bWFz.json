This is a time when families, friends, and colleagues come together to celebrate the spirit of the season.</p>\n<p>“Christmas is an opportunity for giving as well as receiving. Whether it is volunteering time at a local food bank, buying gifts for children in need, or opening doors to someone who may be celebrating alone, the true spirit of Christmas is about connecting with our neighbours and our community.</p>\n<p>“This year, Canadians are welcoming thousands of Syrian refugees to our country — people who have been forced to flee their homeland due to war and conflict. I encourage all Canadians to show them a warm holiday welcome in keeping with our values of compassion, kindness, and generosity.</p>\n<p>“From our family to yours, Sophie and I wish you all a most joyous holiday season and a merry Christmas.”</p></div>\n      "
