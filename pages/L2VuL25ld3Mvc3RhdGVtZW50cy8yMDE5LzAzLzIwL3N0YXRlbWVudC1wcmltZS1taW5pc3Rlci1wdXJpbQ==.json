It is a celebration of the resilience and courage of the Jewish people, and a reminder that it is up to all of us to stand against anti-Semitism, discrimination, and hatred in Canada and around the world.</p>\n\n<p>“Today, we also recognize the contributions that Jewish Canadians make to our country. Canada’s Jewish community has played a critical role in building a stronger, more inclusive Canada, and that’s as true today as ever.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I wish a joyful Purim to all those celebrating.</p>\n\n<p>“Chag Purim Sameach!”</p></div>\n      "
