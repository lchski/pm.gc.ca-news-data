We also recognize their resilience through history, and the significant role they have played in shaping Canada.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">“National Acadian Day traces its roots to the first Acadian national convention held in 1881 in </span>Memramcook, New Brunswick. During that convention, Acadian delegates chose to celebrate their national day on Our Lady of Assumption Day, in recognition of their French Catholic heritage.</p><p>“Descendants of French settlers, Acadians hold a unique place in Canada’s history. Over centuries, they survived a deportation, endured exile, and persevered through relentless persecution. Despite these hardships, Acadians grew into a distinct community with a beautiful language, a colourful culture, and a rich set of customs. Today, Acadian music, poetry, literature, and theatre entertain and inspire people around the world.</p><p>“As we celebrate 150 years since Confederation, we also take time to recognize the people and communities at the heart of Canada’s success. Acadians reflect the vibrant diversity that defines us as a country, and they continue to make important and unique contributions to our national fabric.</p><p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I wish all those celebrating a happy National Acadian Day.”</p></div>\n      "
