It is a time to reflect on our shared values of strength, resilience, and perseverance, and reminds us that every challenge can be overcome.</p>\n\n<p>“This holiday is also an opportunity to celebrate Canada’s Jewish community and the many contributions that they have made – and continue to make – to building a stronger, more inclusive, and resilient country. Today, we also reaffirm our commitment to stand up against antisemitism, oppression, and hatred in all its forms to ensure a better world for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I wish a happy Passover to those celebrating in Canada and around the world.</p>\n\n<p>“!חג פסח שמח</p>\n\n<p>“Chag Pesach Sameach.”</p></div>\n      "
