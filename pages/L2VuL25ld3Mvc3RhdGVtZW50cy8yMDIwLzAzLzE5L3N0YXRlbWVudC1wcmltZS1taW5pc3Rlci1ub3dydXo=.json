It is also a chance for all Canadians to recognize the important contributions the many communities that observe Nowruz make to our country.</p>\n\n<p>“To the many families who will be spending their first Nowruz without the loved ones lost in the Ukraine International Airlines tragedy: know that all Canadians mourn with you.</p>\n\n<p>“Most years, families and friends mark Nowruz by gathering around the haft-seen table to share festive meals. This year, as Canada and countries around the world feel the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, I urge people to celebrate differently by practising social distancing to help limit the spread of the virus. I thank organizers of Nowruz events for their responsible action in past weeks of delaying festivals until a time when we can all safely celebrate together.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish all those celebrating a happy New Year.</p>\n\n<p>“Har Ruz etan Nowrouz, Nowruz etan Pyrouz.”</p></div>\n      "
