This year, as we continue our fight against the global COVID-19 pandemic, I encourage those marking the occasion to come together and celebrate using virtual ways to help keep each other and our communities safe.</p>\n\n<p>“I also invite people to reflect on the many contributions that Christian Canadians have made to our country. Through kindness, compassion, and generosity, they help build a better, and more diverse Canada. Together, we can create a healthier, stronger, and more resilient future for all Canadians.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish all those who are celebrating a very joyful and blessed Easter.”</p></div>\n      "
