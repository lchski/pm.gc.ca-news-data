We recently ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and remain committed to playing a major role in peacekeeping and conflict prevention efforts.</p>\n<p>“On this day, let us pause to reflect on all that the UN has accomplished for the world, and celebrate the employees of its many affiliated programmes, funds, and specialized agencies who work tirelessly to make our global community a safer, more prosperous place. The UN is a vital organization, unparalleled in scope, that is a source of great optimism for a better tomorrow.”</p></div>\n      "
