Our thoughts are with all those who continue to live with the pain, trauma, and heartbreaking loss from these events.</p>\n\n<p>“We also pay tribute to Constable Heidi Stevenson who gave her life while protecting her community and salute Constable Chad Morrison, who was injured when he encountered the gunman. During one of the darkest days in Canadian history, they, along with the many other first responders, faced danger without hesitation – saving lives and preventing further injury that day.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, I invite all Canadians to remember each of those who lost their lives and stand with all those affected by this attack. To all Nova Scotians: you are in our thoughts and you have our unwavering support. We draw inspiration from your strength and resilience.”</p></div>\n      "
