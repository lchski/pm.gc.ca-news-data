As the decades have passed, we have remained united by our shared democratic values and close people-to-people ties. Both of our countries are also benefitting from the modernized Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement, which is creating even more connections between people and businesses in Canada and Israel.</p>\n\n<p>“I look forward to continuing to work closely with the new Israeli government to further strengthen the close relationship enjoyed by our two countries, which includes working together to combat COVID-19. In these times of uncertainty, our commitment to international law and the rules-based international order is more important than ever.”</p></div>\n      "
