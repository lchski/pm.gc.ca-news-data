It reminds us to give generously, and put the needs of others before our own – this month, and throughout the year.</p>\n\n<p>“Each day, Muslim Canadians help build a better Canada. Today, let’s celebrate their contributions, and come together to continue that work. We will always stand together against Islamophobia and hatred in all its forms, and work to make sure the values of openness, diversity, and freedom of religion are protected.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating a blessed and peaceful Ramadan.</p>\n\n<p>“Ramadan Mubarak!”</p></div>\n      "
