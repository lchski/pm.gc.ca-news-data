We are fortunate to live in a country where cultural and religious diversity are considered tremendous strengths, not weaknesses. I invite all Canadians to take this time to reflect on the values we cherish most, and to lend a helping hand to those in need.</p>\n<p>“In the weeks and months ahead, Canada will continue to receive thousands of Syrian refugees. I am certain that these new arrivals will be granted a warm and compassionate welcome from Canadians across our great country, in keeping with our values of kindness and generosity.</p>\n<p>“On behalf of Sophie and our three children, I wish you and your family a blessed Christmas. May the new year be filled with peace, health, and happiness for all.”</p></div>\n      "
