The CCB puts more money in the pockets of nine out of ten families, and helps them with the high costs of raising their children.</p>\n<p>The CCB replaces the Canada Child Tax Benefit, the National Child Benefit Supplement, and the Universal Child Care Benefit. Starting today, it will be issued monthly to eligible families. The CCB is simpler, tax-free, and better targeted to those who need it most. More support means more opportunities for middle-class Canadians to save, invest, and grow the Canadian economy.</p>\n<p>Parents who have received a previous child benefit and who filed their income tax and benefit return for 2015 are automatically assessed for eligibility for the CCB. Parents of newborn children can apply for the CCB using the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/bnfts/tmtd-eng.html\">Automated Benefits Application (ABA)</a>&nbsp;service.</p>\n<p><strong>Quote</strong></p>\n<p>“Too many middle-class families struggle with the high costs of raising their children. The new Canada Child Benefit means more money for healthier groceries, kids’ summer programs, and back-to-school clothes. This new child benefit is much more generous, and will help the Canadian economy grow for years to come.”<br><em>-The Rt. Hon.
