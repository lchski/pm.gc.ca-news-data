Our thoughts are with their families and friends, and all those affected by these attacks.</p><p>“As we pay tribute to these fallen members of the Canadian Armed Forces, we also pay our respects to the brave first responders and members of our Parliamentary family who acted without hesitation to keep us safe.</p><p>“As Canadians, we will not surrender to hatred, and let attacks like these divide us. In the face of cowardly violence and fear mongering, we will not compromise our most cherished values – freedom, democracy, diversity, and inclusion.</p><p>“Today, I encourage everyone to show gratitude to the valiant Canadians in uniform, past and present. Their dedication and service protect and defend everything that Canada stands for.”</p></div>\n      "
