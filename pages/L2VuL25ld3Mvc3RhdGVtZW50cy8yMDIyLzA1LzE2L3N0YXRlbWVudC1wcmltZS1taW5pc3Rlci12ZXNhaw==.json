Buddhists will pour fragrant water over the statue of the infant Buddha, which symbolizes the cleansing of their minds from greed, hatred, and ignorance.</p>\n\n<p>“Today, we reflect on the Buddha’s universal teachings of generosity, compassion, and selfless service. These values unite us as Canadians and, together, as we continue to recover from the pandemic, these values will also ensure that we continue to build a stronger, fairer, and more inclusive country.</p>\n\n<p>“Today, I invite all Canadians to learn more about Buddhist communities and the important contributions they have made – and continue to make – to our country. On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish a joyous and peaceful Vesak to everyone celebrating this sacred day.”</p></div>\n      "
