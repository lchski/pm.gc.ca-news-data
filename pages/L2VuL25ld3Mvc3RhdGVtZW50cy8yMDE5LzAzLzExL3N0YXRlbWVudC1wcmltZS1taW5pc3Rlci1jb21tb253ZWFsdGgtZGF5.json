The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 53 countries, working together to promote democracy, sustainable development, the rule of law, and universal human rights. Canada has been a member from the beginning and has played an important role in its evolution.</p>\n\n<p>“The 2019 theme, ‘A Connected Commonwealth’, encourages all member states to work together to protect our shared environment, including building on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bluecharter.thecommonwealth.org/\">Commonwealth Blue Charter</a>. Adopted last year by Commonwealth leaders, the Charter calls for ambitious and coordinated action to promote the sustainable use of coastal and ocean resources, and protect and preserve our world’s oceans. As a champion for the Blue Charter, Canada is proud to work with Commonwealth partners to build on this progress and create a more sustainable future for all.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, I encourage Canadians to take part in community events for Commonwealth Day and learn more about our shared history. Working together, we can play an important role to tackle the most pressing challenges of our time.”</p></div>\n      "
