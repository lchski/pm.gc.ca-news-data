We grieve with those facing news no parent or family should ever have to face. And our hearts go out to the community that has lost teammates, coaches, friends, and mentors.</p><p>“This is every parent’s worst nightmare. No one should ever have to see their child leave to play the sport they love and never come back.</p><p>“Our national hockey family is a close one, with roots in almost every town – small and big – across Canada. Humboldt is no exception, and today the country and the entire hockey community stand with you.</p><p>“I thank the first responders – the RCMP, the Provincial Response Team, and medical personnel – who worked tirelessly through the night, and continue to respond to this incredibly difficult situation with courage and professionalism.</p><p>“To&nbsp;the entire Humboldt community: We are here for you. As neighbours, as friends, and as Canadians, we grieve alongside you.”</p></div>\n      "
