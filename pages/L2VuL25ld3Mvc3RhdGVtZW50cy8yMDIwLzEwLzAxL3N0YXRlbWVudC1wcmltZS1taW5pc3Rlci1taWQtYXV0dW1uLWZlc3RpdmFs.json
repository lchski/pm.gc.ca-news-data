They also admire the spectacular beauty of the full moon, which represents family unity and prosperity. This year, as we continue to fight the global COVID-19 pandemic and follow health guidelines to keep each other and our communities safe, people will celebrate at home and turn to virtual ways to mark this special day.</p>\n\n<p>“The Festival is also an opportunity to honour the many communities that observe this day. This year in particular, as we see an increase in anti-Asian racism across the country, we are reminded of the importance to speak out against discrimination in all its forms, celebrate our differences, and stay united. We are stronger because of the many contributions that Asian communities have made, and continue to make, to our country.</p>\n\n<p>“On behalf of all Canadians, Sophie and I offer our best wishes to everyone celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival, here in Canada and around the world.”</p></div>\n      "
