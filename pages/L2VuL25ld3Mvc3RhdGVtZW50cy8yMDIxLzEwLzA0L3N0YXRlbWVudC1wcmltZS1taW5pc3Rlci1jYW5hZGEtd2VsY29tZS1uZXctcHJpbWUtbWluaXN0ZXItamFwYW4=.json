We work closely together in international forums, including the G7, G20, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and World Trade Organization. Our extensive trade and investment ties, underpinned by the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, greatly contribute to our economic security.</p>\n\n<p>“I look forward to further deepening the relationship between our two countries. Together, we will advance our shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific and take ambitious action in the fight against climate change. As we continue to address the global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will work to promote greater prosperity for people in Canada and Japan and throughout the Indo-Pacific region.</p>\n\n<p>“I thank outgoing Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide, whom I had the pleasure to meet in person at the G7 Summit in the United Kingdom earlier this year, for his contributions to strengthening Canada-Japan relations. I wish him well in his future endeavours.”</p></div>\n      "
