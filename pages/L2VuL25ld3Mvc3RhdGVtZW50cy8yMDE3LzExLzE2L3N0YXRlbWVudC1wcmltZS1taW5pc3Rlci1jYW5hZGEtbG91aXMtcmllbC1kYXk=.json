Today, we celebrate a man who envisioned – and fought for – a more diverse and more inclusive country.</p><p>“Last year, I promised that federal ministers and Métis Nation leaders would work together to advance meaningful reconciliation and solve important challenges. Earlier this year, we took a significant step toward a renewed government-to-government relationship with the signing of the <a href=\"/en/news/news-releases/2017/04/12/prime-minister-canada-and-president-métis-national-council-welcome\">Canada-Métis Nation Accord</a>. This accord is a solid foundation on which to build a new partnership – one based on recognition of rights, respect, and co-operation.</p><p>“As we continue our journey of reconciliation, I encourage everyone today to honour the Métis people and recognize their many contributions to Canada.”</p></div>\n      "
