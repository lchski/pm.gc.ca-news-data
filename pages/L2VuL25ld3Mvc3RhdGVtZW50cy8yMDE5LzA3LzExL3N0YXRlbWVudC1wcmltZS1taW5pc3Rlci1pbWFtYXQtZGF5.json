On July 11th, 1957, His Highness The Aga Khan became the 49th hereditary Imam – spiritual leader – of the Shia Imami Ismaili Muslims.</p>\n\n<p>“For more than six decades, the Aga Khan has worked to reduce poverty, champion healthcare and education, and defend the rights of the most vulnerable around the world. As a global humanitarian leader, and an advocate for people of all backgrounds and faiths, he inspires us all to do more to serve others and care for our communities.</p>\n\n<p>“Compassion, openness, respect for diversity and human rights – the values the Aga Khan promotes are Canadian values. Canada hosts both the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto – the only museum dedicated to Islamic art in all of North America – and His Highness’ <a href=\"https://www.pluralism.ca/\">Global Centre for Pluralism</a> in Ottawa. We are proud to have bestowed honorary Canadian citizenship on the Aga Khan in 2009.</p>\n\n<p>“Today, let’s reflect on the Aga Khan’s example, and carry his message of compassion forward. All of us can build bridges, celebrate our differences, and make our world a better one.</p>\n\n<p>“I wish all Ismaili Canadians celebrating today a heartfelt Khushiali Mubarak!”</p></div>\n      "
