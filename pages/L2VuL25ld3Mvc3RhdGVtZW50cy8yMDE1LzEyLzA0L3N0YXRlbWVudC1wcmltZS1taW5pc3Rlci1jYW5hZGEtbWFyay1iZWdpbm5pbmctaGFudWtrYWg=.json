For people of the Jewish faith, this eight-day celebration inspires a rekindling of faith in miracles, and serves as a reminder to never forget about the power of even the smallest of lights in dark times.</p>\n<p>“This celebration is an opportunity for us all to recognize the important contributions the Jewish community has made to our country’s cultural landscape over many generations.</p>\n<p>“On behalf of all Canadians, Sophie and I wish everyone celebrating Hanukkah a happy, blessed, and peaceful holiday.”</p>\n<p>“<em>Chag Chanukah Sameach</em>!”</p></div>\n      "
