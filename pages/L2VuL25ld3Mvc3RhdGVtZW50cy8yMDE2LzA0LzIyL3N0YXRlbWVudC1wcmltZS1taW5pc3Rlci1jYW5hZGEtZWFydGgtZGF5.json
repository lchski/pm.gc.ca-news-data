It is an opportunity for us to cherish and celebrate Canada’s natural beauty from coast to coast to coast. We also take this day to reflect on the impact that each and every one of us can – and must have – on the world around us.</p>\n<p>“We must protect our environment – clean air to breathe and clean water to drink means better health for all Canadians. The Government of Canada has already demonstrated leadership and courage as it tackles climate pollution. We have taken important steps with our partners to grow cleaner businesses, develop clean technologies, reduce the footprint of our resource sector, and protect our National Parks.</p>\n<p>“Climate change is the great global challenge of our time, but it is also an opportunity for those willing to solve it. Around the world, communities grapple with the complications of a rapidly changing environment. Strong action is needed to address the issues we face – and build a cleaner, stronger, and more sustainable world.</p>\n<p>“On this day, I encourage all Canadians to join us in our efforts to conserve and safeguard our natural environment. Every single Canadian has a role to play to protect our earth and leave our children a better world than the one we inherited from our parents.”</p></div>\n      "
