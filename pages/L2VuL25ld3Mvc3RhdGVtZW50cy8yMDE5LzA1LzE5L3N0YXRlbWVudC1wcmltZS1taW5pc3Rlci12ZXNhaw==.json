They also reflect on his universal teachings of peace, selfless service, and compassion for others.</p>\n\n<p>“Vesak is an important reminder that we can all put these teachings into practice in our daily lives, and help build a better, more open and inclusive world.</p>\n\n<p>“Today, I invite all Canadians to honour Buddhist communities and their important contributions to our country. On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish a peaceful and happy Vesak to all those observing this sacred day.”</p></div>\n      "
