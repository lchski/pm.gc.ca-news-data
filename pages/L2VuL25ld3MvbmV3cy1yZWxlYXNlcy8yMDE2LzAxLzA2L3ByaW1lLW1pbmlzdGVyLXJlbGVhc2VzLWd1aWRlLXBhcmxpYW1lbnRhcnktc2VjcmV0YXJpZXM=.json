The guide builds on the general principles and direction provided in <a href=\"/en/news/backgrounders/2015/11/27/open-and-accountable-government\"><em>Open and Accountable Government</em></a>, which sets out expectations for the conduct of ministers and describes their roles and responsibilities within government.</p>\n<p><strong>Quote</strong></p>\n<p>“We are focused on modernizing government to make sure that it is open and responsive to the needs of Canadians. Being open with Canadians is one of our top priorities because we believe transparency is a vital element of effective governance.”</p>\n<p><em>- Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada</em></p>\n<p><strong>Quick Facts</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This guide is being published publicly for the first time.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The <em><a href=\"/en/news/backgrounders/2016/01/06/guide-parliamentary-secretaries\">Guide for Parliamentary Secretaries</a></em> has traditionally been issued to new parliamentary secretaries, their ministers, and deputy ministers.
