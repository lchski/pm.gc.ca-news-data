It marks the end of the 10 Days of Awe, and is a time for repentance and renewal.</p>\n<p>“On this occasion, families and loved ones gather to fast and pray, reflect on the past year, and seek peace and reconciliation for the year to come.</p>\n<p>“Yom Kippur is an opportunity for us all to reflect on the tremendous contributions that the Jewish Canadian community has made – and continues to make – to the shaping and building of our great country. We know that Canada is a stronger and more resilient country because of its diversity.</p>\n<p>“On behalf of our entire family, Sophie and I wish an easy fast to all those observing Yom Kippur.</p>\n<p>“G’mar Chatimah Tova.”</p></div>\n      "
