It is a time of renewal, and a chance to appreciate the present – whether by going to church, watching kids hunt for Easter eggs, or coming together around the table.</p><p>“On this occasion, we also take time to reflect on the Easter message of love and hope. The story of the resurrection embodies the meaning of compassion. It challenges us to put into practice what it means to love our neighbours as ourselves – not just today, but every day.</p><p>“For our family, Easter is a chance to celebrate along with Christians across the country. Christians have made foundational contributions to Canada, and Christian Canadians of all backgrounds continue to shape our country’s future for the better.</p><p>“On behalf of our family, Sophie and I wish joy and renewal to all those celebrating Easter.”</p></div>\n      "
