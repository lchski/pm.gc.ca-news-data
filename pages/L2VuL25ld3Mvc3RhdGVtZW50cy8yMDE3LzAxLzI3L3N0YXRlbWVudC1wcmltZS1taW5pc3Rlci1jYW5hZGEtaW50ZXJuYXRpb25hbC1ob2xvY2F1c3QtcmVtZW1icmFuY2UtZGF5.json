We must always remember those who experienced the worst of humanity – in ghettos, cattle cars, and Nazi death camps – and never forget our collective responsibility to prevent the seeds of intolerance and hate from taking root in our communities, country, and world.</p>\n<p>“As we take time today to reflect on the haunting legacy of the Holocaust, let us pay tribute to the strength and spirit of the Jewish people and the many others who persevered during one of the darkest periods of human history.</p>\n<p>“Today, and every day, we reaffirm our commitment to stand against anti-Semitism, xenophobia, and prejudice in all its forms. It is through this commitment that we remember those we have lost and honour those whose stories must never be forgotten.”</p>\n<p><strong>Associated link</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/multiculturalism/holocaust.asp\">Canada and the Holocaust</a></p></div>\n      "
