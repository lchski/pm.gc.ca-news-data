On la Fête nationale du Québec, we honour our province’s distinct history, which has shaped a Canada that is strong in its differences and proud of its diversity.</p><p>“Quebec is a core part of Canada’s founding story, and of its success. Over the years, Québecers have cultivated a unique identity based on the principles of equality, freedom, and democracy. Today, Quebec talent shines on the international stage, and Quebecers’ many contributions, at home and abroad, make all Canadians proud.</p><p>“On Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, we also join Francophones from coast to coast to coast to celebrate the language, the traditions, and the identity of francophone Canada.</p><p>“From one generation to the next, Canada’s Francophones have worked tirelessly to preserve and promote the French language and culture across the country. Francophones have played a leadership role throughout our history, whether socially, economically, or culturally, shaping our common values and our Canadian identity. Today, we celebrate their many contributions to building a strong, open, and prosperous Canada.</p><p>“On behalf of the Government of Canada, Sophie and I extend our best wishes to Quebecers, Francophones, and all those celebrating la Fête nationale du Québec and Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day.”</p></div>\n      "
