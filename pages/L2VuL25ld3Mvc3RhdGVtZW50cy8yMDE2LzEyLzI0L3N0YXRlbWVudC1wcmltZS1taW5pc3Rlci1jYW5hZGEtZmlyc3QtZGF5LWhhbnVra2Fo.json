It teaches us that peace can reign triumphant and that, by working together, we can build a brighter, better world for ourselves and our children.</p>\n<p>“To mark this occasion, family and friends will gather to pray, sing, and light the menorah. They will enjoy food and tell stories of hopefulness and optimism.</p>\n<p>“On behalf of Sophie and our three children, I invite all our country’s citizens to reflect on the immense contributions that Jewish Canadians make to our nation, and wish all those celebrating a happy and peaceful Hanukkah.”</p>\n<p>“<em>Chag Hanukkah Sameach</em>”</p></div>\n      "
